2,B00813GRG4,A1D87F6ZCVE5NK,Product arrived labeled as Jumbo Salted Peanuts
2,B00813GRG4,A1D87F6ZCVE5NK,the peanuts were actually small sized unsalted
2,B00813GRG4,A1D87F6ZCVE5NK,"Not sure if this was an error or if the vendor intended to represent the product as ""Jumbo"""
3,B000LQOCH0,ABXLMWJIXXAIN,This is a confection that has been around a few centuries
3,B000LQOCH0,ABXLMWJIXXAIN,"It is a light, pillowy citrus gelatin with nuts - in this case Filberts"
3,B000LQOCH0,ABXLMWJIXXAIN,And it is cut into tiny squares and then liberally coated with powdered suga
3,B000LQOCH0,ABXLMWJIXXAIN,And it is a tiny mouthful of heaven
3,B000LQOCH0,ABXLMWJIXXAIN,"Not too chewy, and very flavorful"

3,B000LQOCH0,ABXLMWJIXXAIN,"Lewis' ""The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe"" - this is the treat that seduces Edmund into selling out his Brother and Sisters to the Witch"
4,B000UA0QIQ,A395BORC6FGVXV,If you are looking for the secret ingredient in Robitussin I believe I have found it
4,B000UA0QIQ,A395BORC6FGVXV,I got this in addition to the Root Beer Extract I ordered (which was good) and made some cherry soda
4,B000UA0QIQ,A395BORC6FGVXV,The flavor is very medicinal

6,B006K2ZZ7K,ADT0SRK1MGOEU,I got a wild hair for taffy and ordered this five pound bag
6,B006K2ZZ7K,ADT0SRK1MGOEU,"The taffy was all very enjoyable with many flavors: watermelon, root beer, melon, peppermint, grape, etc"
6,B006K2ZZ7K,ADT0SRK1MGOEU,My only complaint is there was a bit too much red/black licorice-flavored pieces (just not my particular favorites)
6,B006K2ZZ7K,ADT0SRK1MGOEU,"Between me, my kids, and my husband, this lasted only two weeks"
6,B006K2ZZ7K,ADT0SRK1MGOEU,I would recommend this brand of taffy -- it was a delightful treat
7,B006K2ZZ7K,A1SP2KVKFXXRU1,This saltwater taffy had great flavors and was very soft and chewy

7,B006K2ZZ7K,A1SP2KVKFXXRU1,"None of the candies were stuck together, which did happen in the expensive version, Fralinger's"
7,B006K2ZZ7K,A1SP2KVKFXXRU1,Would highly recommend this candy
7,B006K2ZZ7K,A1SP2KVKFXXRU1,I served it at a beach-themed party and everyone loved it
8,B006K2ZZ7K,A3JRGQVEQN31IQ,This taffy is so good
8,B006K2ZZ7K,A3JRGQVEQN31IQ,It is very soft and chewy

9,B000E7L2R4,A1MZYO9TZK0BBI,They love it
9,B000E7L2R4,A1MZYO9TZK0BBI,I rotate it around with Wheatgrass and Rye too

10,B00171APVA,A21BT40VZCCYT4,Good for their digestion
10,B00171APVA,A21BT40VZCCYT4,Also good for small puppies
10,B00171APVA,A21BT40VZCCYT4,My dog eats her required amount at every feeding
11,B0001PB9FE,A3HDKO7OW0QNK4,"I don't know if it's the cactus or the tequila or just the unique combination of ingredients, but the flavour of this hot sauce makes it one of a kind"
11,B0001PB9FE,A3HDKO7OW0QNK4,We picked up a bottle once on a trip we were on and brought it back home with us and were totally blown away
11,B0001PB9FE,A3HDKO7OW0QNK4,When we realized that we simply couldn't find it anywhere in our city we were bummed
11,B0001PB9FE,A3HDKO7OW0QNK4,"Now, because of the magic of the internet, we have a case of the sauce and are ecstatic because of it"
11,B0001PB9FE,A3HDKO7OW0QNK4,If you love hot sauce
11,B0001PB9FE,A3HDKO7OW0QNK4,"I mean really love hot sauce, but don't want a sauce that tastelessly burns your throat, grab a bottle of Tequila Picante Gourmet de Inclan"
11,B0001PB9FE,A3HDKO7OW0QNK4,"Just realize that once you taste it, you will never want to use any other sauce"

12,B0009XLVG0,A2725IB4YY9JEB,One of my boys needed to lose some weight and the other didn't
12,B0009XLVG0,A2725IB4YY9JEB,"I put this food on the floor for the chubby guy, and the protein-rich, no by-product food up higher where only my skinny boy can jump"
12,B0009XLVG0,A2725IB4YY9JEB,The higher food sits going stale
12,B0009XLVG0,A2725IB4YY9JEB,They both really go for this food
12,B0009XLVG0,A2725IB4YY9JEB,And my chubby boy has been losing about an ounce a week
13,B0009XLVG0,A327PCT23YH90,My cats have been happily eating Felidae Platinum for more than two years
13,B0009XLVG0,A327PCT23YH90,I just got a new bag and the shape of the food is different
13,B0009XLVG0,A327PCT23YH90,They tried the new food when I first put it in their bowls and now the bowls sit full and the kitties will not touch the food
13,B0009XLVG0,A327PCT23YH90,I've noticed similar reviews related to formula changes in the past
13,B0009XLVG0,A327PCT23YH90,"Unfortunately, I now need to find a new food that my cats will eat"

17,B001GVISJM,A3KLWF6WQ5BNYO,I love eating them and they are good for watching TV and looking at movies
17,B001GVISJM,A3KLWF6WQ5BNYO,It is not too sweet
17,B001GVISJM,A3KLWF6WQ5BNYO,I like to transfer them to a zip lock baggie so they stay fresh so I can take my time eating them
18,B001GVISJM,AFKW14U97Z6QO,I am very satisfied with my Twizzler purchase

24,B001GVISJM,AJ613OLZZUG7V,After weight watchers I had to cut back but still have a craving for it

28,B001GVISJM,AAAS38B98HMIK,I need them for my garage door opene

29,B00144C10S,A2F4LZVGFLD1OB,i was so impressed that i've ordered some for myself (w dark chocolate) to take to the office so i'll eat them instead of snacking on sugary sweets

31,B003F6UO7K,AFM0O9480F04W,I have never been a huge coffee fan
31,B003F6UO7K,AFM0O9480F04W,"However, my mother purchased this little machine and talked me into trying the Latte Macciato"
31,B003F6UO7K,AFM0O9480F04W,"No Coffee Shop has a better one and I like most of the other products, too (as a usually non-coffee drinke"
31,B003F6UO7K,AFM0O9480F04W,)
31,B003F6UO7K,AFM0O9480F04W,The little Dolche Guesto Machine is super easy to use and prepares a really good Coffee/Latte/Cappuccino/etc in less than a minute (if water is heated up)
31,B003F6UO7K,AFM0O9480F04W,I would recommend the Dolce Gusto to anyone

33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,McCann's Instant Oatmeal is great if you must have your oatmeal but can only scrape together two or three minutes to prepare it
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,"There is no escaping the fact, however, that even the best instant oatmeal is nowhere near as good as even a store brand of oatmeal requiring stovetop preparation"
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,"Still, the McCann's is as good as it gets for instant oatmeal"
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,"It's even better than the organic, all-natural brands I have tried"
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,All the varieties in the McCann's variety pack taste good
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,It can be prepared in the microwave or by adding boiling water so it is convenient in the extreme when time is an issue
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,McCann's use of actual cane sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup helped me decide to buy this product
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,Real sugar tastes better and is not as harmful as the other stuff
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,"One thing I do not like, though, is McCann's use of thickeners"
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,"Oats plus water plus heat should make a creamy, tasty oatmeal without the need for guar gum"
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,But this is a convenience product
33,B001EO5QW8,AOVROBZ8BNTP7,"Maybe the guar gum is why, after sitting in the bowl a while, the instant McCann's becomes too thick and gluey"
34,B001EO5QW8,A3PMM0NFVEJGK9,This is a good instant oatmeal from the best oatmeal brand
34,B001EO5QW8,A3PMM0NFVEJGK9,"It uses cane sugar instead of high fructouse corn syrup, so not only does it have a better sweetness, but some doctors now say that this form of sugar is better for you"
34,B001EO5QW8,A3PMM0NFVEJGK9,Great on a cold morning when you don't have time to make McCann's Steel Cut Oats
34,B001EO5QW8,A3PMM0NFVEJGK9,The apple cinnamon is the best but the maple and brown sugar or the regular are good too
34,B001EO5QW8,A3PMM0NFVEJGK9,Plus they don't require doctoring to actually tell the three flavors apart
35,B001EO5QW8,A2EB6OGOWCRU5H,Instant oatmeal can become soggy the minute the water hits the bowl
35,B001EO5QW8,A2EB6OGOWCRU5H,"McCann's Instant Oatmeal holds its texture, has excellent flavor, and is good for you all at the same time"
35,B001EO5QW8,A2EB6OGOWCRU5H,"McCann's regular oat meal is excellent, too, but may take a bit longer to prepare than most have time for in the morning"
35,B001EO5QW8,A2EB6OGOWCRU5H,"This is the best instant brand I've ever eaten, and a very close second to the non-instant variety"
35,B001EO5QW8,A2EB6OGOWCRU5H,"McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)"
36,B001EO5QW8,A2CI0RLADCRKPF,"McCann's Instant Irish Oatmeal, Variety Pack of Regular, Apples & Cinnamon, and Maple & Brown Sugar, 10-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)<br /><br />I'm a fan of the McCann's steel-cut oats, so I thought I'd give the instant variety a try"
36,B001EO5QW8,A2CI0RLADCRKPF,"I found it to be a hardy meal, not too sweet, and great for folks like me (post-bariatric surgery) who need food that is palatable, easily digestible, with fiber but won't make you bloat"
37,B001EO5QW8,A1MYS9LFFBIYKM,For those of us with celiac disease this product is a lifesaver and what could be better than getting it at almost half the price of the grocery or health food store
37,B001EO5QW8,A1MYS9LFFBIYKM,I love McCann's instant oatmeal - all flavors
37,B001EO5QW8,A1MYS9LFFBIYKM,"Thanks,<br />Abby"
38,B001EO5QW8,A3MGP2E1ZZ6GRB,What else do you need to know
38,B001EO5QW8,A3MGP2E1ZZ6GRB,"Oatmeal, instant (make it with a half cup of low-fat milk and add raisins;nuke for 90 seconds)"
38,B001EO5QW8,A3MGP2E1ZZ6GRB,More expensive than Kroger store brand oatmeal and maybe a little tastier or better texture or something
38,B001EO5QW8,A3MGP2E1ZZ6GRB,It's still just oatmeal
38,B001EO5QW8,A3MGP2E1ZZ6GRB,"Mmm, convenient"
39,B001EO5QW8,A2GHZ2UTV2B0CD,"I WAS VISITING MY FRIEND NATE THE OTHER MORNING FOR COFFEE , HE CAME OUT OF HIS STORAGE ROOM WITH ( A PACKET OF McCANNS INSTANT IRISH OATMEAL"

42,B001EO5QW8,A1WK4ALVZDYPUE,What I personally like about McCann's is that it cooks up thicker and with more body than the top brand here in America
42,B001EO5QW8,A1WK4ALVZDYPUE,"The Apples & Cinnamon, though, tends to be a little liquidy so you may want to experiment with the amount of water you add"
42,B001EO5QW8,A1WK4ALVZDYPUE,"In my 1300watt microwave the oatmeal cooks up in about one minute and twenty-seven seconds, so you should also watch that to get a handle on how much time and water to use"
42,B001EO5QW8,A1WK4ALVZDYPUE,The only bad thing -- if you can consider it a bad thing -- about this offering is that you have to buy in lot so you'll end up with six ten-count boxes
42,B001EO5QW8,A1WK4ALVZDYPUE,"This is good if you have a whole family of oatmeal-eaters, but if you're a single person alone -- well, love oatmeal"
43,B001EO5QW8,A16XFOYQSJREL7,I have McCann's Oatmeal every morning and by ordering it from Amazon I am able to save almost $3
43,B001EO5QW8,A16XFOYQSJREL7,00 per box
43,B001EO5QW8,A16XFOYQSJREL7,It is a great product
43,B001EO5QW8,A16XFOYQSJREL7,Tastes great and very healthy
44,B001EO5QW8,A17DW6SUOC70DJ,McCann's Oatmeal is a good quality choice
44,B001EO5QW8,A17DW6SUOC70DJ,"Our favorite is the Apples and Cinnamon, but we find that none of these are overly sugary"
44,B001EO5QW8,A17DW6SUOC70DJ,"For a good hot breakfast in 2 minutes, this is excellent"
45,B001EO5QW8,A2G7B7FKP2O2PU,We really like the McCann's steel cut oats but find we don't cook it up too often
45,B001EO5QW8,A2G7B7FKP2O2PU,This tastes much better to me than the grocery store brands and is just as convenient
45,B001EO5QW8,A2G7B7FKP2O2PU,Anything that keeps me eating oatmeal regularly is a good thing
46,B001EO5QW8,A39Z97950MCTQE,"This seems a little more wholesome than some of the supermarket brands, but it is somewhat mushy and doesn't have quite as much flavor eithe"
46,B001EO5QW8,A39Z97950MCTQE,"It didn't pass muster with my kids, so I probably won't buy it again"
47,B001EO5QW8,AQLL2R1PPR46X,Good oatmeal
47,B001EO5QW8,AQLL2R1PPR46X,I like the apple cinnamon the best
47,B001EO5QW8,AQLL2R1PPR46X,Though I wouldn't follow the directions on the package since it always comes out too soupy for my taste
47,B001EO5QW8,AQLL2R1PPR46X,That could just be me since I like my oatmeal really thick to add some milk on top of
48,B001EO5QW8,A26AY1TFK8BQXQ,The flavors are good
48,B001EO5QW8,A26AY1TFK8BQXQ,"However, I do not see any differce between this and Oaker Oats brand - they are both mushy"
49,B001EO5QW8,ALOR97KTZTK1P,I really like the Maple and Brown Sugar flavo
49,B001EO5QW8,ALOR97KTZTK1P,The regular is fine with brown sugar added
49,B001EO5QW8,ALOR97KTZTK1P,The Apples and Cinnamon flavor is OK
49,B001EO5QW8,ALOR97KTZTK1P,"This is a very quick, easy and satisfying breakfast and I'll order this brand again, but not the variety"
49,B001EO5QW8,ALOR97KTZTK1P,I'll get all Maple and Brown Suga
50,B001EO5QW8,A276999Y6VRSCQ,This is the same stuff you can buy at the big box stores
50,B001EO5QW8,A276999Y6VRSCQ,There is nothing healthy about it
50,B001EO5QW8,A276999Y6VRSCQ,It is just carbs and sugars
50,B001EO5QW8,A276999Y6VRSCQ,Save your money and get something that at least has some taste
51,B001EO5QW8,A108P30XVUFKXY,This oatmeal is not good
51,B001EO5QW8,A108P30XVUFKXY,"Its mushy, soft, I don't like it"
51,B001EO5QW8,A108P30XVUFKXY,Quaker Oats is the way to go
52,B000G6RPMY,A3S5KJDA6ED2PS,"Got a free package of these with a bottle of bloody mary mix I bought from the seller, and the advertising worked"
52,B000G6RPMY,A3S5KJDA6ED2PS,"lol,  I tried them, and shared them with 2 buddies, and we all loved them"
52,B000G6RPMY,A3S5KJDA6ED2PS,"So im here to buy more, and noticed there were no reviews yet,"
52,B000G6RPMY,A3S5KJDA6ED2PS,well now there is
52,B000G6RPMY,A3S5KJDA6ED2PS,"They are Hot,  but not ""burn your mouth forever hot""  its a nice temp"
52,B000G6RPMY,A3S5KJDA6ED2PS,Perfect for us
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,This wasn't in stock the last time I looked
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,"I had to go to the Vermont Country Store in Weston to find it along with a jaw harp, Cranberry Horseradish Sauce, Fartless Black Bean Salsa, Apple Cider Jelly, Newton's Cradle Art in Motion and the staple Vermont Maple Syrup"
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,Back to the Ass Kickin Peanuts
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,They are hot
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,They will activate the perspiration glands behind your ears and under your arms
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,"It requires a beverage as advertised, a glass of very cold milk, and a box of Kleenex since it will make your nose run"
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,They look like ordinary peanuts which is already giving me ideas for work
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,"I suspect that some people have been hitting my goodies in my absence, especially my colleague Greg"
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,"I'm going to take this to work at earliest opportunity and empty the contents of this can into an ordinary Planters Peanuts can, and then see whose crying or whose nose is running when I return"
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,The can should be shaken to ensure the spices are evenly distributed
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,It is important to wash your hands after consumption and not touch the eyes
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,You'll go nuts over these Ass-Kickin' Peanuts
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,P
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,S
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,"I'm not sharing the peanuts, not deliberately, and I'll probably give Greg the jaw harp for Christmas"
53,B000G6RPMY,A9L6L5H9BPEBO,He'll be so insulted
54,B000G6RPMY,AQ9DWWYP2KJCQ,we're used to spicy foods down here in south texas and these are not at all spicy
54,B000G6RPMY,AQ9DWWYP2KJCQ,doubt very much habanero is used at all
54,B000G6RPMY,AQ9DWWYP2KJCQ,could take it up a notch or two
55,B002GWHC0G,A1ND7WC5LXOU48,"I roast at home with a stove-top popcorn popper (but I do it outside, of course)"
55,B002GWHC0G,A1ND7WC5LXOU48,These beans (Coffee Bean Direct Green Mexican Altura) seem to be well-suited for this method
55,B002GWHC0G,A1ND7WC5LXOU48,"The first and second cracks are distinct, and I've roasted the beans from medium to slightly dark with great results every time"
55,B002GWHC0G,A1ND7WC5LXOU48,The aroma is strong and persistent
55,B002GWHC0G,A1ND7WC5LXOU48,"The taste is smooth, velvety, yet lively"
56,B002GWHC0G,A2EFAW1P3DRXWO,We roast these in a large cast iron pan on the grill (about 1/3 of the bag at a time)
56,B002GWHC0G,A2EFAW1P3DRXWO,The smell is wonderful and the roasted beans taste delicious too
56,B002GWHC0G,A2EFAW1P3DRXWO,"More importantly, the coffee is smooth; no bitter aftertaste"
56,B002GWHC0G,A2EFAW1P3DRXWO,"On numerous occasions, we've had to send the roasted beans home with friends because they like it so much"
57,B004N5KULM,A202WR509428VF,Deal was awesome
57,B004N5KULM,A202WR509428VF,Arrived before Halloween as indicated and was enough to satisfy trick or treaters
57,B004N5KULM,A202WR509428VF,I love the quality of this product and it was much less expensive than the local store's candy
58,B004N5KULM,ASCNNAJU6SXF8,"It is chocolate, what can I say"
58,B004N5KULM,ASCNNAJU6SXF8,Great variety of everything our family loves
58,B004N5KULM,ASCNNAJU6SXF8,With a family of six it goes fast here
58,B004N5KULM,ASCNNAJU6SXF8,Perfect variety
58,B004N5KULM,ASCNNAJU6SXF8,"Kit Kat, Reeses, take five and more"
59,B004N5KULM,A2A7KXM9B4XW90,"Great product, nice combination of chocolates and perfect size"
59,B004N5KULM,A2A7KXM9B4XW90,"The bags had plenty, and they were shipped promptly"
59,B004N5KULM,A2A7KXM9B4XW90,The kids in the neighborhood liked our candies
60,B004N5KULM,A2QOGOXPOVKAJG,"Halloween is over but, I sent a bag to my daughters class for her share"
60,B004N5KULM,A2QOGOXPOVKAJG,The chocolate was fresh and enjoyed by many
61,B004N5KULM,A1ZR8O62VSU4OK,Watch your prices with this
61,B004N5KULM,A1ZR8O62VSU4OK,"While the assortment was good, and I did get this on a gold box purchase, the price for this was<br />$3-4 less at Target"
62,B004N5KULM,A7ZK2A3VIW7X9,"This bag of candy online is pretty expensive, it should be cheaper in order to compete with grocery stores, other than that, its a good combination of my favorite candy"
63,B001EO5TPM,A1E09XGZUR78C6,Arrived in 6 days and were so stale i could not eat any of the 6 bags
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,I have used the endurolyte product for several years in both pill and powder form
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,"Long desert rides on the dirt bike always found my camelbak water heavily laced with the endurolyte powder, not overly tasty, but quite effective, as I never got a cramp on these several hundred mile rides"
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,"Same for desert racing in the buggy, the camelbaks were always laced with the powde"
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,Now we have the Fizz
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,what a great product
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,"Firstly, its Hammer's endurolyte product so it's great, endurance athlete's the world over use their products"
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,"Second its convenient, handly tablets that dissovle in a fizz"
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,Third it tastes great
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,"Imagine getting a nice cool drink when your body is starving for hydration and electrolytes and rather than getting a ""salty"" taste, you get a refreshing lemon-lime or mango"
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,The camelbaks always get the Fizz now
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,I also drop a tablet in my bottled water whenever I exercise and have a nice flavored water chock full of electrolytes
64,B005DUM9UQ,A3HR0ZZOFKQ97N,I cannot recommend this product or any hammer product highly enough
65,B005DUM9UQ,A2XIHNXODNZGV4,This product serves me well as a source of electrolytes during and after a long run or bike ride
65,B005DUM9UQ,A2XIHNXODNZGV4,I have tried all of the flavors but really do like the grapefruit flavo
65,B005DUM9UQ,A2XIHNXODNZGV4,no after-taste and I actually like the slight carbonation
65,B005DUM9UQ,A2XIHNXODNZGV4,I use other Hammer products and really like their whole product line
66,B005DUM9UQ,A3TWF9DQ6MU87E,This stuff really works for preventing cramping during the middle to latter stages of your rides
66,B005DUM9UQ,A3TWF9DQ6MU87E,Pop 1 into each water bottle and you're set
66,B005DUM9UQ,A3TWF9DQ6MU87E,Flavor is fine and goes down easy
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,For those of us on a low carb diet these little tablets are just the thing
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,Two years ago I started cycling again after many years but was having heart arrhythmia after longer rides in high heat
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,I was drinking plain water but did a little research and thought electrolytes might be the issue
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,Gatorade wasn't an option because it is so loaded with carbohydrates so I looked around for a low-carb alternative
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,"The ""zero carb"" sports drinks didn't help so what to do"
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,One day I ran across these at my bike shop so tried a tube of them
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,voila
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,problem solved
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,I've shared them with two friends in particular whose problems with leg cramps were resolved while using these
67,B005DUM9UQ,AEFIZIJ1FK1BK,These guys got it right -- they are superbly formulated and simply work
68,B005DUM9UQ,A8OFFIAL6XTOH,"I purchased the Mango flavor, and to me it doesn't take like Mango at all"
68,B005DUM9UQ,A8OFFIAL6XTOH,"There is no hint of sweetness, and unfortunately there is a hint or aftertaste almost like licorice"
68,B005DUM9UQ,A8OFFIAL6XTOH,"I've been consuming various sports nutrition products for decades, so I'm familiar and have come to like the taste of the most of the products I've tried"
68,B005DUM9UQ,A8OFFIAL6XTOH,The mango flavor is one of the least appealing I've tasted
68,B005DUM9UQ,A8OFFIAL6XTOH,"It's not terrible, but it's bad enough that I notice the bad taste every sip I take"
69,B000E7VI7S,A1KL2LAW08X6UQ,"If you're impulsive like me, then $6 is ok"
69,B000E7VI7S,A1KL2LAW08X6UQ,"Don't get me wrong, the quality of these babies is very good and I have no complaints"
69,B000E7VI7S,A1KL2LAW08X6UQ,"But in retrospect, the price is a little ridiculous (esp"
69,B000E7VI7S,A1KL2LAW08X6UQ,when you add on the shipping)
70,B000E7VI7S,AWCBF2ZWIN57F,this was sooooo deliscious but too bad i ate em too fast and gained 2 pds
70,B000E7VI7S,AWCBF2ZWIN57F,my fault
71,B001GVISJC,A27TKQHFW0FB5N,These Albanese gummi bears and rings and so on are very good and tasty and high quality
71,B001GVISJC,A27TKQHFW0FB5N,The bears even have little faces
71,B001GVISJC,A27TKQHFW0FB5N,"At my local candy store this type of gummi stuff (bears, rings, snakes, balls, worms, whatever) are about $10/l"
71,B001GVISJC,A27TKQHFW0FB5N,These twin packs of 4
71,B001GVISJC,A27TKQHFW0FB5N,5 or 5 pound bags is a screaming deal as far as I'm concerned
71,B001GVISJC,A27TKQHFW0FB5N,I'm probably 50 pounds deep in these friggin' things
71,B001GVISJC,A27TKQHFW0FB5N,Consumed
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,Grape gummy bears are hard to find in my area
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,In fact pretty much anyone I talk to about grape gummy bears they think I'm lying
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,So I bought 10lbs
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,": ) These bears are a little bit bigger then the other brands and have kind of sour kick, but nothing to strong"
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,I love grape flavored candy/soda and these are pretty good
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,"There is another company that makes grape gummy bears that are a little bit better in my opinion, but these are well worth it for the price"
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,I like to use the gummy bears in home made Popsicles with flavored sports drink
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,"The salt in the sports drink makes for softer popsicles, and the gummy bears are awesome frozen"
72,B001GVISJC,A3BDOAPSF96WGQ,They are delicious
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,I ordered two of these and two of raspberry latice tarts directly from FantasiCakes website for a dinner party I was hosting
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,It arrived fresh and intact
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,Very good size
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,I froze half for later use
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,I am a pastry lover and these were the best I've ever tasted
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,"The pastry was soft, the jam was really good and the taste was great"
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,They were gone in no time
73,B006SQBRMA,ATYMT48R62ENE,My guests were really impressed
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,Buyer Beware Please
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,This sweetener is not for everybody
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,"Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced"
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,"As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant"
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,"Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate"
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,"The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters"
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,"Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it"
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,"In case you're like me,"
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,it's not you
74,B0059WXJKM,A25VFHVGI4CFTP,it's the maltitol
75,B001EPPI84,A3Q0IDQ03S0158,It is okay
75,B001EPPI84,A3Q0IDQ03S0158,I would not go out of my way to buy it again
76,B001EPPI84,A27TZ4WBU7N0YF,No tea flavor at all
76,B001EPPI84,A27TZ4WBU7N0YF,Just whole brunch of artifial flavors
76,B001EPPI84,A27TZ4WBU7N0YF,It is not returnable
76,B001EPPI84,A27TZ4WBU7N0YF,I wasted 20+ bucks
77,B004X2KR36,A2W3ABLWMJ84NS,These looked like a perfect snack to through in with my trail mix
77,B004X2KR36,A2W3ABLWMJ84NS,"Unfortunately, they arrived in a solid mass of melted chocolate"
77,B004X2KR36,A2W3ABLWMJ84NS,"I left them in my pantry for a few days, and when I opened them at room temperature they were still gooey"
77,B004X2KR36,A2W3ABLWMJ84NS,I through them in the fridge and I've been breaking off hunks ever since
77,B004X2KR36,A2W3ABLWMJ84NS,"They taste good to me, but the chocolate is all grainy after melting and then solidifying again"
77,B004X2KR36,A2W3ABLWMJ84NS,"I won't order them online again, but if I see them in a store I would pick them up"
78,B004X2KR36,A26M5O53PHZTKN,These taste really good
78,B004X2KR36,A26M5O53PHZTKN,I have been purchasing a different brand and these are very similar in taste and texture
78,B004X2KR36,A26M5O53PHZTKN,I agree with the other reviewer regarding ordering in the summe
78,B004X2KR36,A26M5O53PHZTKN,There is no insulating packaging with ice packs so they will melt in warm weather like all chocolate food items
78,B004X2KR36,A26M5O53PHZTKN,Order in cold weather and buy enough to last
79,B004X2KR36,A2AB7M9UCNBVN7,"The taste was great, but the berries had melted"
79,B004X2KR36,A2AB7M9UCNBVN7,May order again in winte
79,B004X2KR36,A2AB7M9UCNBVN7,If you order in cold weather you should enjoy flavo
80,B005R8JE8O,A3H1EQD2PBC085,i know i cannot make tea this good
80,B005R8JE8O,A3H1EQD2PBC085,"granted, i am not from the south but i know i have never enjoyed tea that was this sweet without being too sweet"
80,B005R8JE8O,A3H1EQD2PBC085,it tastes crisp
81,B0066DMI6Y,AB30HQTI5VOLR,This peppermint stick is delicious and fun to eat
81,B0066DMI6Y,AB30HQTI5VOLR,My dad got me one for Christmas because he remembered me having a similar one when I was a little girl
81,B0066DMI6Y,AB30HQTI5VOLR,I'm 30 now and I love it
82,B0066DMI6Y,AZLONLC8OZPEC,Great gift for all ages
82,B0066DMI6Y,AZLONLC8OZPEC,"I purchased these giant canes before and the recipients loved them so much, they kept them and would not eat them"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"I know the product title says Molecular Gastronomy, but don't let that scare you off"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"I have been looking for this for a while now, not for food science, but for something more down to earth"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,I use it to make my own coffee creame
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"I have to have my coffee blonde and sweet - but the flavored creamers are full of the bad kinds of fat, and honestly, I hate to use manufactured ""food"" items"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,I really don't think they are good for the body
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"On the other hand, I hate using cold milk or cream, because I like HOT coffee"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,I stumbled across this on Amazon one day and got the idea of making my own creame
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,I also bought low-fat (non-instant) milk powder and regular milk powde
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"The non-instant lowfat milk is a little sweeter and tastes fresher than regular instant low-fat milk, but does not dissolve good in cold water - which is not a problem for hot coffee"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"You will have to play with the ratios - I would not do just the heavy cream, it made the coffee too rich"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"Also, I think the powder is too expensive to just use on it's own"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,I like mixing 1/3 of each togethe
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"For flavoring, I bough cocoa bean powder, vanilla bean powder, and caster (superfine) suga"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,I mix up small batches along with spices like cinnamon and nutmeg to make my own flavored creamers
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"If you wanted, you could use a fake sweetner powder instead"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,I make up small amounts that I store in jelly canning jars
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"I also use my little food chopper/food processor to blend everything, so the sugar is not heavier and sinks to the bottom"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,Let it settle for a bit before opening the top though
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,This stuff tastes WAY better than the storebought creamers and it is fun to experiment and come up with your own flavors
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,I am going to try using some essential oils next and see if I can get a good chocolate/orange mix
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,All of the ingredients I mentioned are here online
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,Take the time to experiment
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,Maybe you don't use any low-fat milk
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,Or don't add any flavorings
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,It is up to you
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"Also, would make great housewarming/host(ess) gifts"
83,B003ZFRKGO,A2VOZX7YBT0D6D,"I am sure other molecular people will be able to tell you more of what you can do with it, and I am sure I will experiment with it in cooking - but the main reason I bought it was to make my own creamer and it worked out great"
84,B0019CW0HE,A1FD9E5C06UB6B,"While my dogs like all of the flavors that we have tried of this dog food, for some reason their itching increased when I tried the lamb and rice"
84,B0019CW0HE,A1FD9E5C06UB6B,I have some very itchy dogs and am giving them a limited ingredient dog food to try to help
84,B0019CW0HE,A1FD9E5C06UB6B,"The duck and sweet potato cut down on the itching significantly, but when we tried lamb and rice they started itching more once again"
84,B0019CW0HE,A1FD9E5C06UB6B,I like Natural Balance for the quality ingredients
85,B0019CW0HE,AK2CXHH9VRZ2A,Awesome dog food
85,B0019CW0HE,AK2CXHH9VRZ2A,"However, when given to my ""Boston"", who has severe reactions to some food ingredients; his itching increased to violent jumping out of bed at night, scratching"
85,B0019CW0HE,AK2CXHH9VRZ2A,"As soon as I changed to a different formula, the scratching stopped"
85,B0019CW0HE,AK2CXHH9VRZ2A,So glad Natural Balance has other choices
85,B0019CW0HE,AK2CXHH9VRZ2A,"I guess you have to try each, until you find what's best for your pet"
86,B0019CW0HE,A25BGFRHYHEZKK,We have three dogs and all of them love this food
86,B0019CW0HE,A25BGFRHYHEZKK,"We bought it specifically for one of our dogs who has food allergies and it works great for him, no more hot spots or tummy problems"
86,B0019CW0HE,A25BGFRHYHEZKK,I LOVE that it ships right to our door with free shipping
87,B0019CW0HE,A37N9XZBB8JYOF,My dog has a ton of allergies both environmental and food
87,B0019CW0HE,A37N9XZBB8JYOF,She was on a prescription dog food before we had her tested to see what allergies she has
87,B0019CW0HE,A37N9XZBB8JYOF,"After we got the test back, we learned she was allergic to something in the prescription brand"
87,B0019CW0HE,A37N9XZBB8JYOF,So I finally found this dog food and she has done so well on this
87,B0019CW0HE,A37N9XZBB8JYOF,"She still has her environmental triggers, but I am happy she can finally eat something I know won't cause her pain"
88,B0019CW0HE,A1T4L0Q47OZ9N,My shepherd/collie mix has IBS
88,B0019CW0HE,A1T4L0Q47OZ9N,Our vet recommended a limited ingredient food
88,B0019CW0HE,A1T4L0Q47OZ9N,This has really helped her symptoms and she likes it
88,B0019CW0HE,A1T4L0Q47OZ9N,I will always buy it from Amazon
88,B0019CW0HE,A1T4L0Q47OZ9N,it's $10 cheaper and free shipping
89,B0019CW0HE,A3IMXZE9FCUNOC,Natural Balance Dry Dog Food Lamb Meal and Brown Rice Recipe did wonders for my Jack Russell
89,B0019CW0HE,A3IMXZE9FCUNOC,She has awful food allergy's and this food was our last hope because it was the last food we could find that didn't have SOMETHING in it that she was allergic to
89,B0019CW0HE,A3IMXZE9FCUNOC,She has no problem eating it dry but normally I mix the Natural Balance Dry Lamb and Brown Rice with the Natural Balance Wet Lamb and Brown Rice
89,B0019CW0HE,A3IMXZE9FCUNOC,she seems to like that bette
89,B0019CW0HE,A3IMXZE9FCUNOC,We started feeding it to our other dog (a Bichon) too and she loves it
89,B0019CW0HE,A3IMXZE9FCUNOC,If your dog has allergy's or stomach issue
89,B0019CW0HE,A3IMXZE9FCUNOC,or if you want your dog to eat better food-- this is it
89,B0019CW0HE,A3IMXZE9FCUNOC,You will see a difference in your pet
90,B0019CW0HE,A1EC57S6C2VLTL,Great food
90,B0019CW0HE,A1EC57S6C2VLTL,I love the idea of one food for all ages & breeds
90,B0019CW0HE,A1EC57S6C2VLTL,Ît's a real convenience as well as a really good product
90,B0019CW0HE,A1EC57S6C2VLTL,"My 3 dogs eat less, have almost no gas, their poop is regular and a perfect consistency, what else can a mom ask fo"
91,B0019CW0HE,A1OGD72Y2Y26CF,I have a standard poodle and pomeranian who both do wonderful on this food
91,B0019CW0HE,A1OGD72Y2Y26CF,I have switched them to a different food (due to price) a couple of times and end up going right back to natural balance
92,B0019CW0HE,A7JWCYVPF7KCO,"This is great dog food, my dog has severs allergies and this brand is the only one that we can feed him"
93,B0019CW0HE,ABG53EBZBKD23,This food is great - all ages dogs
93,B0019CW0HE,ABG53EBZBKD23,I have a 3 year old and a puppy
93,B0019CW0HE,ABG53EBZBKD23,They are both so soft and hardly ever get sick
93,B0019CW0HE,ABG53EBZBKD23,The food is good especially when you have Amazon Prime shipping  :)
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,My golden retriever is one of the most picky dogs I've ever met
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,"After experimenting with various types of food, I have found she loves natural balance"
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,What I really like about natural balance is the fact that it has multiple flavors in dry and wet varieties
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,I mix her dry food with a little wet food and my golden loves it
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,"Furthermore, I do like mixing up the flavors each time as I think the same meal day over day might get a little boring, so I figured why not"
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,I tend to stay away from the fish type though as it smells
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,"Additionally, I started purchasing off Amazon because Petco didn't have the wet food box and only had a couple of cans"
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,I came home and to my surprise realized that I could save $20 each time I bought dog food if I just buy it off Amazon
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,"All in all, I definitely recommend and give my stamp of approval to natural balance dog food"
94,B0019CW0HE,A3AF72GP4GVRY1,"While I have never eaten it, my dog seems to love it"
95,B0019CW0HE,A1DJAAKLPCJRZD,This is the same food we get at pet store
95,B0019CW0HE,A1DJAAKLPCJRZD,But it's delivered to my doo
95,B0019CW0HE,A1DJAAKLPCJRZD,And for the same price or slightly less
96,B0019CW0HE,A1BFNM27629VAV,I've been very pleased with the Natural Balance dog food
96,B0019CW0HE,A1BFNM27629VAV,Our dogs have had issues with other dog foods in the past and I had someone recommend Natural Balance grain free since it is possible they were allergic to grains
96,B0019CW0HE,A1BFNM27629VAV,Since switching I haven't had any issues
96,B0019CW0HE,A1BFNM27629VAV,It is also helpful that have have different kibble size for larger/smaller sized dogs
97,B0019CW0HE,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,My 1-1/2 year old basenji/jack russell mix loves this dog food
97,B0019CW0HE,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,He's been noticeably healthier and more energetic since I switched him over from the standard dog foods earlier this yea
97,B0019CW0HE,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,"Despite the higher cost of natural dog foods, I find that he eats significantly less of the Natural Balance dog foods and still stays happy and full"
97,B0019CW0HE,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,"On the normal dog foods, he'd eat up to 3 cups of dog food a day (the recommended serving for his size), whereas he only eats about 1 cup to 1-1/2 cup of the Natural Balance dog food a day"
97,B0019CW0HE,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,"When you take this into account, you're actually getting more ""bang for your buck"" with the natural dog foods since you don't have to buy as much to last just as long as the normal dog foods"
97,B0019CW0HE,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,"and a healthier, happier dog, to boot"
97,B0019CW0HE,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,"Add in the fact that you can get free, 2-day shipping with Amazon Prime"
97,B0019CW0HE,A18AAABCIJKC5Q,I'm sold
98,B0019CW0HE,A3UII2114114PI,Our pup has experienced allergies in forms of hotspots and itching from other dog foods
98,B0019CW0HE,A3UII2114114PI,The cheap 'you can buy it anywhere' food not only have crazy preservatives in them but can cause health problems for your pets
98,B0019CW0HE,A3UII2114114PI,This food works wonders on reducing allergies and our dog loves the food
98,B0019CW0HE,A3UII2114114PI,This message is RAMSEY FrAnkenSteiN approved
99,B0019CW0HE,ABZ9F0D94YK45,My English Bulldog had skin allergies the summer we got him at age 3
99,B0019CW0HE,ABZ9F0D94YK45,The vet recommended we wean him off the food his previous owner gave him (Iams Lamb and Rice) and onto a new kind
99,B0019CW0HE,ABZ9F0D94YK45,"This was the second one we tried, and it has been working ever since"
99,B0019CW0HE,ABZ9F0D94YK45,It's for dogs that need a limited diet who can be sensitive to additives and proteins commonly found in commercial dog food (like chicken or beef)
100,B0019CW0HE,A2P6ACFZ8FTNVV,I fed this to my Golden Retriever and he hated it
100,B0019CW0HE,A2P6ACFZ8FTNVV,"He wouldn't eat it, and when he did, it gave him terrible diarrhea"
100,B0019CW0HE,A2P6ACFZ8FTNVV,We will not be buying this again
100,B0019CW0HE,A2P6ACFZ8FTNVV,It's also super expensive
101,B004K2IHUO,A1SYSKR79LA2CB,"The mouth says, ""How do I love thee, let me count the ways"
101,B004K2IHUO,A1SYSKR79LA2CB,"""<br />If you like apple products a must have item"
101,B004K2IHUO,A1SYSKR79LA2CB,"The only draw back, shipping cost"
101,B004K2IHUO,A1SYSKR79LA2CB,These are very heavy
102,B004K2IHUO,A3D1TXE98KRKYO,Arrived slightly thawed
102,B004K2IHUO,A3D1TXE98KRKYO,My parents wouldn't accept it
102,B004K2IHUO,A3D1TXE98KRKYO,"However, the company was very helpful and issued a full refund"
103,B004K2IHUO,AVCA516CFZ9HF,The crust on these tarts are perfect
103,B004K2IHUO,AVCA516CFZ9HF,"My husband loves these, but I'm not so crazy about them"
103,B004K2IHUO,AVCA516CFZ9HF,They are just too sour/tart for my taste
103,B004K2IHUO,AVCA516CFZ9HF,I'll eat the crust and hubby takes my filling
103,B004K2IHUO,AVCA516CFZ9HF,"My kids think they're great, so maybe it's just me"
104,B004K2IHUO,A1P21J0DMTVGS7,These are absolutely scrumptuous
104,B004K2IHUO,A1P21J0DMTVGS7,"My husband and I both love them, however, as another customer put it, they are expensive to ship"
104,B004K2IHUO,A1P21J0DMTVGS7,The cost of shipping is more than the tartlets themselves are
105,B004K2IHUO,AL3E5V6MXO9B0,What a nice alternative to an apple pie
105,B004K2IHUO,AL3E5V6MXO9B0,Love the fact there was no slicing and dicing
105,B004K2IHUO,AL3E5V6MXO9B0,Easy to prepare
105,B004K2IHUO,AL3E5V6MXO9B0,I also loved the fact that you can make them fresh whenever needed
106,B004K2IHUO,A2O9G2521O626G,I like Creme Brulee
106,B004K2IHUO,A2O9G2521O626G,I loved that these were so easy
106,B004K2IHUO,A2O9G2521O626G,Just sprinkle on the sugar that came with and broil
106,B004K2IHUO,A2O9G2521O626G,They look amazing and taste great
106,B004K2IHUO,A2O9G2521O626G,My guess thought I really went out of the way for them when really it took all of 5 minutes
106,B004K2IHUO,A2O9G2521O626G,I will be ordering more
107,B004K2IHUO,A1ZKFQLHFZAEH9,not what I was expecting in terms of the company's reputation for excellent home delivery products
108,B001REEG6C,A30835UIR6F8KB,I first bought pickled asparagus at an Amish market and it was love at first bite
108,B001REEG6C,A30835UIR6F8KB,"Hence, when I saw these on the discount rack at the local Safeway I cleaned it out"
108,B001REEG6C,A30835UIR6F8KB,These are even better than the ones from the Amish market
108,B001REEG6C,A30835UIR6F8KB,"They are fantastic, and some of the jars have a bonus clove of garlic at the bottom"
108,B001REEG6C,A30835UIR6F8KB,I'm going to order the six pack and I'm a household of one
108,B001REEG6C,A30835UIR6F8KB,They wont go to waste
109,B001REEG6C,A10EHUTGNC4BGP,I love asparagus
109,B001REEG6C,A10EHUTGNC4BGP,"Up until very recently, I had never had pickled asparagus"
109,B001REEG6C,A10EHUTGNC4BGP,"Oh my goodness, when a friend introduced me to this exact brand, I couldn't believe how great stuff tasted"
109,B001REEG6C,A10EHUTGNC4BGP,I loved it so much I bought the six pack
109,B001REEG6C,A10EHUTGNC4BGP,I've got 2 jars left
109,B001REEG6C,A10EHUTGNC4BGP,Gonna need more
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,I'm presently on a diet and I was at my Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Grocery looking over possible diet foods
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,"I wanted things that were tasty, non-fat and low in calories"
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,I came home with about a dozen items
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,That's how I discovered the Tillen Farms Pickled Crispy Asparagus
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,"Well, I've always liked asparagus anyway and I've enjoyed several brands of pickled asparagus"
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,"This Tillen Farms brand is really, really good"
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,It's the best I can recall
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,There's an excellent flavor and a big clove of garlic down in  the bottom of the jar which I'm looking forward to eating
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,"I can't believe how good this asparagus tastes and right on the front it says ""only 60 calories per ja"
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,""" Now this is my idea of a good diet food"
110,B001REEG6C,AY12DBB0U420B,Gary Peterson
111,B000J0HIT2,A1VKJN5Y1C7S5Y,I was diappointed in the flavor and texture of this mix
111,B000J0HIT2,A1VKJN5Y1C7S5Y,"I usually like most of the Low Carb things I have tried, but was diappointed in this specific one"
112,B0037LW78C,A3VEYLW2KPZNGK,I have been drinking this tea for a long time now
112,B0037LW78C,A3VEYLW2KPZNGK,I used to have to purchase it at a doctor's office because it wasn't available elsewhere
112,B0037LW78C,A3VEYLW2KPZNGK,I'm so glad that I can buy it now from Amazon
112,B0037LW78C,A3VEYLW2KPZNGK,com
112,B0037LW78C,A3VEYLW2KPZNGK,I drink this tea throughout the day like other folks drink coffee
112,B0037LW78C,A3VEYLW2KPZNGK,Wonderful taste
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,I have been drinking Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea (100 tea bags x 2g each) as my every day tea for several years now
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,I buy 12 boxes at a time to save on shipping
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,For many years I used to drink coffee from morning till night
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,But finally I realized that drinking so much coffee was not healthy for me
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,I finally resolved to improve my health and stopped drinking coffee all togethe
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,I tried many alternative drinks to replace my coffee habit
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,I found that green tea was not only good tasting it also has health benefits
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,Green tea is one of the few drinks that actually makes you healthier (coffe and other drinks do not) - the only healthier drink is quality cold wate
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,"In my opinion, for the price, Royal King 100% Natural Organic Green Tea is one of the best tasting teas"
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,"This green tea has a beautiful golden color, the taste is bright and fresh"
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,I recommend adding a tiny amount of Y
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,S
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,Organic Bee Farms RAW HONEY to the tea to add sweetness and health benefits too
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,I also give myself a treat once in a while by having a much more expense tea (Tribute Xi Hu Long Jing) but this fantastic tea is not practical for me to drink as my every day tea (although I would if I could afford it)
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,Cons:  On my latest shipment the package shown on the Amazon page is different than the one shipped
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,"The one shipped displays ""NATURALLY HIGH IN POLYPHENOL CATECHINS"" (a key contributive element to the possible health effects of tea), whereas the Amazon package displays ""CAFFENE FREE"""
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,So I am not sure if this green tea is Caffene free or not
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,The other con is that sometimes the tea bag rips open when I unwrap the string from around the tea bag
113,B0037LW78C,A2F65U0UDY7TAW,So if the string seems stuck to the tea bag I put the bag in the hot water to unstick it
114,B0037LW78C,AWNANZ5VUO7IB,this has to be one of the best teas I have ever tasted
114,B0037LW78C,AWNANZ5VUO7IB,"it's clean, bright, fresh"
114,B0037LW78C,AWNANZ5VUO7IB,great delivery
114,B0037LW78C,AWNANZ5VUO7IB,again quality
114,B0037LW78C,AWNANZ5VUO7IB,just try it
115,B0037LW78C,A1Q4PJXI5HS5WT,"I love, love this green tea"
115,B0037LW78C,A1Q4PJXI5HS5WT,It is very hard to find in our area and some places on the internet charge a big price and I usually don't get as many boxes as I did with this merchant
115,B0037LW78C,A1Q4PJXI5HS5WT,I will definitely order from this seller again
115,B0037LW78C,A1Q4PJXI5HS5WT,Thanks
115,B0037LW78C,A1Q4PJXI5HS5WT,I depend on my green tea fix everyday
116,B0037LW78C,A2IX1B76ONTXEL,I love this tea
116,B0037LW78C,A2IX1B76ONTXEL,It helps curb my eating during the day
116,B0037LW78C,A2IX1B76ONTXEL,My Mom and I have given it all friends to try
117,B0026Y3YBK,A3P60QLFDDCHOY,I'm Italian and I lived in Italy for years
117,B0026Y3YBK,A3P60QLFDDCHOY,I used to buy these cookies for my everyday breakfast with an Italian espresso
117,B0026Y3YBK,A3P60QLFDDCHOY,"I couldn't find them anywhere here in the Bay area, so it's great to have them again"
118,B0026Y3YBK,A38BUM0OXH38VK,In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy
118,B0026Y3YBK,A38BUM0OXH38VK,This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack
118,B0026Y3YBK,A38BUM0OXH38VK,They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then
118,B0026Y3YBK,A38BUM0OXH38VK,They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy
118,B0026Y3YBK,A38BUM0OXH38VK,It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon
118,B0026Y3YBK,A38BUM0OXH38VK,"Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk"
118,B0026Y3YBK,A38BUM0OXH38VK,Great routine and treat for kids
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"I had heard a little about this product from the local pet store, then tried a small bag for our 2 cats of about 3 and 6 years respectively"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"The female, younger one took to it right away, and the older male, who was unfortunately weaned on the junk cat food with all the corn meal and etc"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"in it, and would usually refuse a diet change, actually liked it too"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"The older male is overweight and we were trying to switch him to soft food on the doctor's request, but he totally refused it"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,He is a posh cat after all
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"He still consumes too many calories, the fatty, but at least I know he's eating good food"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"Of course, I know this product seems to cost more than most other feline food on the market, but I just can't see feeding our animals the lousy alternatives that are out there, marketed as being healthy"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,Why do commercials show cats eating a vegetarian diet which is mostly corn meal
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,Is that right
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"I'll stay with this for now, but stay tuned"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,I'm updating this review after 9 months of using this cat food for our two cats
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,I upgraded the stars from 4 to 5 as it really has been a good food for the two of them
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"Garfield still eats a little too much, but he's just a big cat who doesn't exercise much, let's face it"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,Our female cat will be 4 years old in a couple months and she's so healthy
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"She's tiny, but happy and agile"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,"I tried the chicken version of Holistic Select, but Garfield seemd to miss this sardine version so we went back to this one"
119,B003SE19UK,AD1WWGMEQ8FWW,I've ordered the duck version and will update this once they try it
120,B003SE19UK,A2PM49X61MWZJV,"I started buying this after I noticed my 1 year old cat was already starting to lose his ""spunk"" so I decided it was time to start buying him ""real"" cat food"
120,B003SE19UK,A2PM49X61MWZJV,not the garbage in the super markets
120,B003SE19UK,A2PM49X61MWZJV,"I found this at the pet store out of the other million choices, and I'm sure there are other brands that are just as good but this is the one I went with to try first and it was a great purchase"
120,B003SE19UK,A2PM49X61MWZJV,My cat has been on this for the past 8 months and he's now just has active as he was when he was a kitten and his coat has became sooo soft
120,B003SE19UK,A2PM49X61MWZJV,"Mainly, he loved the taste even more"
120,B003SE19UK,A2PM49X61MWZJV,I highly recommend this brand to all my friends and family for their animals
121,B003SE19UK,A3A52DETIFZNZS,"I have done a lot of research to find the best food for my cat, and this is an excellent food"
121,B003SE19UK,A3A52DETIFZNZS,That is also according to my holistic veterinarian
121,B003SE19UK,A3A52DETIFZNZS,"They put probiotics on the kibble as the last step, which is very important to me"
121,B003SE19UK,A3A52DETIFZNZS,The best thing is that my cat loved it immediately and I had to stop mixing it with the old food because she only would eat Holistic Select
122,B003SE19UK,A3L15C30CBPZOR,This cat food was recommended by my vet because my 13 year old Cleo Cat was having trouble keeping any food down and was loosing weight
122,B003SE19UK,A3L15C30CBPZOR,It stopped her problems
122,B003SE19UK,A3L15C30CBPZOR,She doesn't eat as much as before since she seems to be more satisfied after eating which helps justify the added price
122,B003SE19UK,A3L15C30CBPZOR,It aids in digestion since the
122,B003SE19UK,A3L15C30CBPZOR,ok sorry
122,B003SE19UK,A3L15C30CBPZOR,smells are gone if ya know what I mean
122,B003SE19UK,A3L15C30CBPZOR,Had to add that so anyone experiencing problems with their cats can see there are a lot of benifits from this cat food
123,B003SE19UK,A29SUR9R8ZU54B,I have a 4 year old male cat who has chronic urinary tract infections
123,B003SE19UK,A29SUR9R8ZU54B,I feed him this dry food in combination with wet food (with water added to it) and Uri Ease
123,B003SE19UK,A29SUR9R8ZU54B,The combination seems to keeps his UTI's under control
123,B003SE19UK,A29SUR9R8ZU54B,"If I switch to another type of dry food, his UTI gets worse"
123,B003SE19UK,A29SUR9R8ZU54B,The other cats seem to enjoy this food as well
123,B003SE19UK,A29SUR9R8ZU54B,It's expensive but it seems to be the best solution for me
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,"Before I was educated about feline nutrition, I allowed my cats to become addicted to dry cat food"
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,"I always offered both canned and dry, but wish I would have fed them premium quality canned food and limited dry food"
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,I have two 15 year old cats and two 5 year old cats
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,The only good quality dry foods they will eat are Wellness and Innova
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,Innova's manufacturer was recently purchased by Procter&Gamble
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,I began looking for a replacement
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,After once again offering several samples (from my local holistic pet store) Holistic Select was the only one (other than the usual Wellness and Innova) they would eat
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,"For finicky cats, I recommend trying Holistic Select"
124,B003SE19UK,A9GRWS6KP8SMA,It is a good quality food that is very palatable for finicky eaters
125,B003SE19UK,ASOEVZ99YWPVL,"My holistic vet recommended this, along with a few other brands"
125,B003SE19UK,ASOEVZ99YWPVL,"We tried them all, but my cats prefer this (especially the sardine version)"
125,B003SE19UK,ASOEVZ99YWPVL,The best part is their coats are so soft and clean and their eyes are so clea
125,B003SE19UK,ASOEVZ99YWPVL,"AND (and I don't want to be rude, so I'll say this as delicately as I can) their waste is far less odorous than cats who eat the McDonalds junk found in most stores, which is a definite plus for me"
125,B003SE19UK,ASOEVZ99YWPVL,The health benefits are so obvious - I highly recommend Holistic Select
126,B003SE19UK,A1QAJ948PN36II,One of my cats is allergic to fish and beef
126,B003SE19UK,A1QAJ948PN36II,"This formula is one of the few she can eat, and it has much better ingredients than the prescription diets available at the vet"
126,B003SE19UK,A1QAJ948PN36II,"Both of my kitties are very active, have soft shiny fur, and neither are fat"
126,B003SE19UK,A1QAJ948PN36II,"Dry food reduces tartar buildup on teeth, also"
127,B003SE19UK,A1LWFJRITZLYUG,Our cats thrive extremely well on this dry cat food
127,B003SE19UK,A1LWFJRITZLYUG,They definitely have much less hair ball throw ups and their fur is great
127,B003SE19UK,A1LWFJRITZLYUG,They are fit and not over weight
127,B003SE19UK,A1LWFJRITZLYUG,This vendor ships extremely fast
127,B003SE19UK,A1LWFJRITZLYUG,Is one of the top Amazon suppliers in our book
128,B003OB0IB8,A34UG2TNXIL0Y,I've been a fan of Hot & Spicy Maruchan Ramen for a long time
128,B003OB0IB8,A34UG2TNXIL0Y,"If you enjoy spice, and love ramen, you'll love this product"
128,B003OB0IB8,A34UG2TNXIL0Y,Too bad it's way too expensive here on Amazon
128,B003OB0IB8,A34UG2TNXIL0Y,It's only $3
128,B003OB0IB8,A34UG2TNXIL0Y,36 per 12 at my Walmart
129,B003OB0IB8,A3NVZTGPORNPRW,"I've been eating Ramen noodles since I was a little kid, and I've never found a better flavor than Hot & Spicy Chicken"
129,B003OB0IB8,A3NVZTGPORNPRW,"It isn't hot at all to a chilihead like me, but it sure is good"
130,B003OB0IB8,A28D854VMOEHGX,"I LOVE spicy ramen, but for whatever reasons this thing burns my stomach badly and the burning sensation doesn't go away for like 3 hours"
130,B003OB0IB8,A28D854VMOEHGX,Not sure if that is healthy or not
130,B003OB0IB8,A28D854VMOEHGX,and you can buy this at Walmart for $0
130,B003OB0IB8,A28D854VMOEHGX,"28, way cheaper than Amazon"
131,B003OB0IB8,AISIYS3D2EAOX,"Always being a fan of ramen as a quick and easy meal, finding it on amazon for a decent price and having it delivered to your door by the case is an amazing situation for anyone to find themselves in"
132,B003OB0IB8,A2DLRG3YX6A2ZU,"I must be a bit of a wuss, because this soup tastes to me how I imagine fire might taste"
132,B003OB0IB8,A2DLRG3YX6A2ZU,Typically I like spicy food if it has a good flavo
132,B003OB0IB8,A2DLRG3YX6A2ZU,I don't find this to be the case with this soup
132,B003OB0IB8,A2DLRG3YX6A2ZU,Any flavor is killed off by the burn
133,B003OB0IB8,A56HS2VNURVJ0,I really loved the spicy flavor these had
133,B003OB0IB8,A56HS2VNURVJ0,I found myself liking the broth more than the noodles which is usually the opposite
133,B003OB0IB8,A56HS2VNURVJ0,If you aren't used to the heat this might bother you and if you like hot hot foods this might not be enough
134,B003OB0IB8,AOTEC8KEH8JGN,"Got these on sale for roughly 25 cents per cup, which is half the price of my local grocery stores, plus they rarely stock the spicy flavors"
134,B003OB0IB8,AOTEC8KEH8JGN,These things are a GREAT snack for my office where time is constantly crunched and sometimes you can't escape for a real meal
134,B003OB0IB8,AOTEC8KEH8JGN,This is one of my favorite flavors of Instant Lunch and will be back to buy every time it goes on sale
135,B003OB0IB8,A1D0URD0AL237J,i have bought allot of different flavors and this happens to be one of my favorites and will be getting more soon
136,B003OB0IB8,A2BZNXMV0LC7OE,I love this flavor of ramen
136,B003OB0IB8,A2BZNXMV0LC7OE,I don't eat other flavors anymore because they taste too bland by comparison
136,B003OB0IB8,A2BZNXMV0LC7OE,"For the convenience of having it delivered to my home (I have prime, so I get it in two days and don't have to pay for the shipping), the price on amazon isn't bad at all, but it is still cheaper to run down and pick up a case of this at the grocery store"
137,B002SRYRE8,A198FU6P1BVUNZ,The BEST investment I've ever made for ginge
137,B002SRYRE8,A198FU6P1BVUNZ,It's unbelievable
137,B002SRYRE8,A198FU6P1BVUNZ,"It's fibrous like the real ginger, has that spicy kick to it, but it's perfect with the sugar - calms it down"
137,B002SRYRE8,A198FU6P1BVUNZ,It's very worth the $40 for 5lbs of it
137,B002SRYRE8,A198FU6P1BVUNZ,I'll be getting more soon - I use these as a topper for my ginger cupcakes and cookies :)
138,B002SRYRE8,A21E0OJ4DSKXNA,Delicious
138,B002SRYRE8,A21E0OJ4DSKXNA,I cannot get Australian ginger where I live
138,B002SRYRE8,A21E0OJ4DSKXNA,This compares favorably to Australian Ginger I've purchased in other cities
138,B002SRYRE8,A21E0OJ4DSKXNA,Now I can enjoy it without traveling
139,B002SRYRE8,A1FJJQA34W0F4K,I keep trying other brands
139,B002SRYRE8,A1FJJQA34W0F4K,cheaper brands
139,B002SRYRE8,A1FJJQA34W0F4K,Stupid me
139,B002SRYRE8,A1FJJQA34W0F4K,This ginger IS soooo worth the money
139,B002SRYRE8,A1FJJQA34W0F4K,"Tender, moist and never a let down"
140,B002SRYRE8,A20PK3OCKRRSA5,"My son has had acid reflux since birth and has been on every medication available with no improvement, Until an older gentleman came into his work place and told him about this product and I automatically ordered it for him"
140,B002SRYRE8,A20PK3OCKRRSA5,I was really not expecting any better results than the 1000 other things we have tried
140,B002SRYRE8,A20PK3OCKRRSA5,What a surprise
140,B002SRYRE8,A20PK3OCKRRSA5,He has not had any heartburn or symptoms since day 2 of starting eating one piece of this Ginger each morning
140,B002SRYRE8,A20PK3OCKRRSA5,He can now eat anything and actually enjoy it
140,B002SRYRE8,A20PK3OCKRRSA5,This product was a God send for him
140,B002SRYRE8,A20PK3OCKRRSA5,Thank you all for it
141,B001GVISJW,ARS5Q7LR6HWPG,I bought this for our office to give people something sweet to snack on
141,B001GVISJW,ARS5Q7LR6HWPG,Because it's bite size it's easier for people to grab a couple a pieces rather than an entire licorice stick
141,B001GVISJW,ARS5Q7LR6HWPG,My only complaint is that one of the bags broke open in shipping
142,B001GVISJW,A2YIO225BTKVPU,Twizzlers brand licorice is much better than that other well known brand
142,B001GVISJW,A2YIO225BTKVPU,If you can get these for $2 to $2
142,B001GVISJW,A2YIO225BTKVPU,50 a package with free s/h it's a good deal
142,B001GVISJW,A2YIO225BTKVPU,The black and cherry have good taste; but the strawberry taste was too delicate and barely there
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,I love these
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,very tasty
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,"Infact, I think I am addicted to them"
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,Buying them in packs of 6 bags - is very reasonable than going to Target and getting a bag
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,Savings are about a $1
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,00 a bag
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,I use subscribe and save on these and several other product
143,B001GVISJW,A1ROND7G1QTOFY,I love subscribe and save
144,B001GVISJW,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,"If you are looking for a less messy version of licorice for the children, then be sure to try these"
144,B001GVISJW,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,"They're soft, easy to chew, and they don't get your hands all sticky and gross in the car, in the summer, at the beach, etc"
144,B001GVISJW,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,We love all the flavos and sometimes mix these in with the chocolate to have a very nice snack
144,B001GVISJW,A1Z54EM24Y40LL,"Great item, great price too, highly recommend"
145,B001GVISJW,A281387UUS2IN5,"I might be mistaken, but it appears that the pieces in this bag were reduced in size"
145,B001GVISJW,A281387UUS2IN5,"If they did do that, it was doubtlessly done to make it appear that the buyer got a better deal, having so many pieces after all"
145,B001GVISJW,A281387UUS2IN5,The problem is that the pieces have to be a certain size in order to have enough flavor for your eating experience
145,B001GVISJW,A281387UUS2IN5,"As it is, you have to use 2 or 3 pieces to match the old piece size;  it is not the same"
146,B0017I8UME,A2NH6XPAZG881D,"Being a fan of Newman's Pineapple salsa for quite a while, I was looking for a comparable salsa"
146,B0017I8UME,A2NH6XPAZG881D,This is one of the best tasting salsas I've ever had
146,B0017I8UME,A2NH6XPAZG881D,My daughters love it too
146,B0017I8UME,A2NH6XPAZG881D,They don't like super chunky salsa and the Berry Mango has a nice smooth texture with small mango pieces
146,B0017I8UME,A2NH6XPAZG881D,"The salsa is not too sweet, just sweet enough and although it's mild, it has a nice little kick to it"
146,B0017I8UME,A2NH6XPAZG881D,"At this price, it's a steal"
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,"The SALSA smelled delicious, as I think it probably was - but, unfortunately, the person, at AMAZON, that is a packer (there is probably several) had very little ""stuffing"" to work with, especially on the bottoms"
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,"Therefore, the bottoms were broken on all three bottles"
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,As I reached for my computer; I was told NO RETURNS (cause it's a food item)
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,"I then looked for a CUSTOMER SERVICE tag; and I found ""none"" on their NEW FACE LIFT"
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,THEY SEEM TO BE PROUD OF THEIR NEW FACE LIFT BUT
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,THEY SHOULD AT LEAST HAVE A PLACE TO CONTACT THEM IN EMERGENCIES
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,"LIKE: I BUY A LOT OF ""STUFF"" AND IT ALL COMES IN STYROFOAM BOXES"
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,NEVER WOULD I SHIP THINGS<br />ESPECIALLY SALSA - IN A CARDBOARD BOX WITH JUST A STRIPE OF LARGE BUBBLE WRAP ON IT
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,"NO MATTER HOW MUCH THE CARRIER (FED EX) IS CAREFUL, IT'S GOING TO BREAK SOMEWHERE ALONG THE LINE"
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,ESPECIALLY IN AN ALL GLASS CONTAINER
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,BARBARA L
147,B0017I8UME,AKX0RW482WAFD,S
148,B0017I8UME,ATBE88PKKQTRA,This is one of the best salsas that I have found in a long time but stay away from the variety pack
148,B0017I8UME,ATBE88PKKQTRA,The other two that come with it are not worth your money
149,B0064KU9HO,AJFIH0DZYJF7T,These remind me of dog treats I made once using pumpkin and cinnamon
149,B0064KU9HO,AJFIH0DZYJF7T,They're kind of bland and not my favorite Back To Nature product
149,B0064KU9HO,AJFIH0DZYJF7T,But my finace really loves them so that's where the three stars come from
150,B0037ZFEW4,ABTKZKAWOK4DC,This is the best cornmeal
150,B0037ZFEW4,ABTKZKAWOK4DC,I made regular cornbread and hot water cornbread with this meal and both were outstanding
150,B0037ZFEW4,ABTKZKAWOK4DC,"Also fried some oysters with this meal, it gave them a great texture and flovo"
151,B00374XSVY,AC567LXSKDNC1,This is a fabulous marinade
151,B00374XSVY,AC567LXSKDNC1,"I love to use it for chicken, either baked in the oven OR on the grill"
151,B00374XSVY,AC567LXSKDNC1,"This has enough flavor & flair, I've even used it for dinner parties, only to receive rave reviews from my guests"
151,B00374XSVY,AC567LXSKDNC1,DEFINITELY worth the price
151,B00374XSVY,AC567LXSKDNC1,Super cheap and super easy
151,B00374XSVY,AC567LXSKDNC1,Love it
152,B00374XSVY,A2PW7DRW757OL0,Works with chicken fish beef or pork
152,B00374XSVY,A2PW7DRW757OL0,Fast easy and makes it taste excellent
152,B00374XSVY,A2PW7DRW757OL0,Plus buying in bulk is more than 50% off from box stores
153,B005P0HHGK,AISCBGJRPPZ5G,Got this for my brother who is on Jorge Cruise diet and decided to try one for myself
153,B005P0HHGK,AISCBGJRPPZ5G,It actually tastes pretty good

154,B002HQAXUW,A17ESTP5T7T1PH,"Hazelnut coffee creamer is my favorite, but truly this is not a good buy"
155,B000SV90J8,A1CY94Z8YWQV12,AWESOME
155,B000SV90J8,A1CY94Z8YWQV12,such a yummy flavor I got it as a healthy alternative to the desserts we normally eat and I am so glad that I did there are so many things you can do with Jello desserts and still have them taste good and be good for you
155,B000SV90J8,A1CY94Z8YWQV12,I will definitentally be purchasing this product again the flavor was so wonderful
156,B000SV90J8,A3OO3TXDSIJDHY,I went to 4 grocery stores looking for this flavor of Jello for my green tomato jam recipe and finally found it here
156,B000SV90J8,A3OO3TXDSIJDHY,This jello is wonderful
156,B000SV90J8,A3OO3TXDSIJDHY,"Evidently it's only carried in the stores during the summer but with harvest time in the Fall, I couldn't find it anywhere in town"
156,B000SV90J8,A3OO3TXDSIJDHY,This Jello tastes like watermelon and the jam recipe I made with it takes like watermelon jam
156,B000SV90J8,A3OO3TXDSIJDHY,Great made as regular Jello too
156,B000SV90J8,A3OO3TXDSIJDHY,Yummy
157,B0036VM05I,AUIVXYS8E4DEX,What a deal this is the healthiest salt you can use
157,B0036VM05I,AUIVXYS8E4DEX,This box should last our family the year no problem
157,B0036VM05I,AUIVXYS8E4DEX,Iodized sea salt will not raise your blood pressure as regular salt will
158,B0036VM05I,A335SFRERY214N,Perfect size sea salt for the table or the picnic basket
158,B0036VM05I,A335SFRERY214N,We love it
158,B0036VM05I,A335SFRERY214N,"Shakes well, no clumping and flows freely"
159,B000ITVLE2,A3NID9D9WMIV01,"span class=""tiny""> Length:: 0:26 Mins<br /><br /></span>The expiration date is 21 months from the day I bought this product"
159,B000ITVLE2,A3NID9D9WMIV01,"The tuna, tomato combination is delicious"
159,B000ITVLE2,A3NID9D9WMIV01,This is one of the many items I re-order on Amazon every month or so
159,B000ITVLE2,A3NID9D9WMIV01,"edit: added a short video, so you see what this combination looks like"
159,B000ITVLE2,A3NID9D9WMIV01,"I was wearing one of those headlamps, but I didn't do a good job focusing on the tuna"
159,B000ITVLE2,A3NID9D9WMIV01,"I should film it over, but it doesn't look like many people view this product anyway"
160,B000ITVLE2,A395S4RA1X7BFB,I've never heard of the SAFCOL brand before but I was tired of only trying the typical pouches; Starkist and Chicken of the Sea
160,B000ITVLE2,A395S4RA1X7BFB,I was really surprised as I thought it was a bit better than the other brands and with less seasoning
161,B000ITVLE2,ADL44P8Z4A3M5,"these are the best tasting tuna pack they make in my opinion - make a great on the go snack, and really satisfying with the tomato"
162,B000ITVLE2,A1K37I9HWF3SAI,I have always purchased Star-Kist tuna but thought I would try this brand for a change of pace
162,B000ITVLE2,A1K37I9HWF3SAI,"The taste of the tuna was not pleasant, too much basil and other spices for me"
163,B000ITVLE2,A6Y8N2GHDH0ZO,"I'm not familiar with the Safcol brand but being a tuna addict, gave this a shot"
163,B000ITVLE2,A6Y8N2GHDH0ZO,The tuna tastes like it's good quality but I found the tomato basil flavor to be a bit bland
163,B000ITVLE2,A6Y8N2GHDH0ZO,It's better than something plain but it didn't pack the punch I was hoping fo
163,B000ITVLE2,A6Y8N2GHDH0ZO,"It's still a great option for a low calorie, low fat meal"
164,B000ITVLE2,A5X6PJANY4XW4,I found it much tastier than the plain tuna pouches out there
164,B000ITVLE2,A5X6PJANY4XW4,"Excellent quality, and no need to 'dress it up'"
164,B000ITVLE2,A5X6PJANY4XW4,I put it the micro on about 20% power for 1 minute and Shazam
164,B000ITVLE2,A5X6PJANY4XW4,I believe a little heating brings out the flavo
165,B000ITVLE2,ARTBQH9WOZTIV,Seriously this product was as tasteless as they come
165,B000ITVLE2,ARTBQH9WOZTIV,There are much better tasting products out there but at 100 calories its better than a special k bar or cookie snack pack
165,B000ITVLE2,ARTBQH9WOZTIV,You just have to season it or combine it with something else to share the flavo
166,B003TQQKFQ,A2TUJ3MOKXZVYK,I read about pomegranate molasses so I had to try it
166,B003TQQKFQ,A2TUJ3MOKXZVYK,"I haven't made anything with it yet, just eaten a little bit at a time but WOW is it decadent"
166,B003TQQKFQ,A2TUJ3MOKXZVYK,"It's dark, syrupy, sour, and a little sweet"
166,B003TQQKFQ,A2TUJ3MOKXZVYK,A dab of this and I forget about dessert
166,B003TQQKFQ,A2TUJ3MOKXZVYK,It's just a really unique flavor with a pleasing metallic undertone
166,B003TQQKFQ,A2TUJ3MOKXZVYK,Yum
166,B003TQQKFQ,A2TUJ3MOKXZVYK,I'm going to try making fesenjan next :-)
167,B003TQQKFQ,A2QHQM3HHFUSHG,"Used this in Moroccan recipes, as a syrup in a brilliant mixed beverage and as a swirled topping on sliced oranges soaked in orange wate"
167,B003TQQKFQ,A2QHQM3HHFUSHG,"Wonderful, wonderful stuff"
168,B007B9J6G2,A34YK0ZTWOR858,"I don't know how long these sat on the back of a shelf somewhere, but they were so old that they wouldn't cook"
168,B007B9J6G2,A34YK0ZTWOR858,"I had to throw half of them out, because the skins were damaged, a clear sign of dried beans past their prime"
168,B007B9J6G2,A34YK0ZTWOR858,"I can't even return these or ask for a refund, because food is not returnable"
168,B007B9J6G2,A34YK0ZTWOR858,Will find a different brand to use
168,B007B9J6G2,A34YK0ZTWOR858,"For now, I have about fifty servings of beans to throw away"
169,B0064KO0BU,A34D61RQILOKIJ,"Besides being smaller than runts, they look the same and have the same consistency"
169,B0064KO0BU,A34D61RQILOKIJ,"Unfortunately, they taste nothing like banana runts"
169,B0064KO0BU,A34D61RQILOKIJ,nor do they even taste good
169,B0064KO0BU,A34D61RQILOKIJ,Yucky stuff
169,B0064KO0BU,A34D61RQILOKIJ,Trying to return with vendo
170,B0064KO0BU,AAV3AEI6YSYA2,"The item over all was fine, but the Banana Heads are not just like Banana Runts they are alot smalle"
170,B0064KO0BU,AAV3AEI6YSYA2,"Also when I received the item, the packaging was not great"
170,B0064KO0BU,AAV3AEI6YSYA2,The Banana Heads had come open during shipping and were all over the packing envelope
171,B0064KO0BU,A104Y49ZQ4CYJ2,I purchased as a giveaway for a baby shower with Jungle theme
171,B0064KO0BU,A104Y49ZQ4CYJ2,They worked out perfect for 25 small bags of candy
171,B0064KO0BU,A104Y49ZQ4CYJ2,I purchased 5#
171,B0064KO0BU,A104Y49ZQ4CYJ2,"If you want more than 25 small bags, I would purchase a larger bag"
172,B001IUKD76,A2KVCXTQVN18KI,I have drunk Ricore since my mother allowed be to drink caffeine
172,B001IUKD76,A2KVCXTQVN18KI,I love this stuff in milk
172,B001IUKD76,A2KVCXTQVN18KI,It's much smoother and tastier than instant coffee with milk
172,B001IUKD76,A2KVCXTQVN18KI,"I am French and live in the US,<br />and bring back boxes of Ricore at every opportunity"
172,B001IUKD76,A2KVCXTQVN18KI,Savora is another hidden gem you can bring<br />back
172,B001IUKD76,A2KVCXTQVN18KI,Check it out
173,B001IUKD76,A2K8UBI64T0BM8,I first had this drink when my mother brought it back with her from a visit to her home in Brittany France and thought it was delicious
173,B001IUKD76,A2K8UBI64T0BM8,"I wish it were a bit cheaper but other than that, I love this product"
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,"I couldn't wait to try the 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake because it is made with fresh eggs, creamy sour cream, Madagascar Bourbon Vanilla and is topped and filled with cinnamon streusel"
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,This 8&#8243; Cinnamon Coffee Cake is available online for only $18
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,95
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,"Now, I have had my fair share of cinnamon coffee cakes, but, let me just tell you that the FantasiCakes Cinnamon Coffee Cake really ""takes the cake"" with size, price, quality and taste"
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,The cake arrived very fast and was carefully packaged so that it arrived in almost perfect condition
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,"It also comes with a large tub of white icing that you can drizzle over the top, before serving"
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,"I couldn't believe how large the size was and it actually fed my family of 5 for us to enjoy during breakfast, for three days"
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,The cake itself is thick and almost has a solid but sponge cake type consistency that is really moist and very filling
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,The flavors are to die for with the sticky cinnamon outside and sweet cinnamon and vanilla swirled throughout the inside of the cake
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,The icing really tops it off beautifully and gives it that moist and sticky sweet flavo
174,B0081XN2HQ,A3HUV0ZQPXO3V7,Pair the cake with your morning coffee and you've got the perfect breakfast treat
175,B0025VRCJY,A3PPOTV6659ATF,I used to love these growing up and stopped drinking water and lemon juice from this brand about 5-6 years ago
175,B0025VRCJY,A3PPOTV6659ATF,This stuff used to be so strong i used to just pour some in my mouth and get that alive feeling going
175,B0025VRCJY,A3PPOTV6659ATF,It feels like the product went through changes which added more water or something to make it not so strong
175,B0025VRCJY,A3PPOTV6659ATF,The stronger it is the less you use as well
175,B0025VRCJY,A3PPOTV6659ATF,The product is still really good but the taste is the same quality as the cheaper brand names almost
175,B0025VRCJY,A3PPOTV6659ATF,I thought  these would go fast but hey all lemon stuff i love unless it goes bad
175,B0025VRCJY,A3PPOTV6659ATF,This is a good product just wish it still had that hit me in the mouth chug sensation it used to be like
176,B0025VRCJY,A2VYRRDJN2UKWB,One of the best lemon juice that I have tried
176,B0025VRCJY,A2VYRRDJN2UKWB,I am recurring customer due to the high quality of this product
176,B0025VRCJY,A2VYRRDJN2UKWB,"When the season for fresh lemos is out, this one supplement our need for the citrus on the kitchen or refreshments"
176,B0025VRCJY,A2VYRRDJN2UKWB,I will continue buying it
177,B0025VRCJY,A2ACUGNVT36JYX,This lemon juice is a must in my kitchen year-round
177,B0025VRCJY,A2ACUGNVT36JYX,It has a powerful flavor and you don't need much of it to zest up a dish
177,B0025VRCJY,A2ACUGNVT36JYX,I add a spritz of it to my water nearly every day
177,B0025VRCJY,A2ACUGNVT36JYX,I will buy this product again and again
178,B0025VRCJY,A3F8JQ5J29GWUV,Fast delivery and good product
178,B0025VRCJY,A3F8JQ5J29GWUV,"This is the same lemon juice concentrate you can find in stores and it's really handy to have around to add to sauces, dressings, etc"
178,B0025VRCJY,A3F8JQ5J29GWUV,"Such a pain to squeeze fresh juice everytime you need it, nevermind having the lemons on hand to begin with"
179,B0025VRCJY,A3L9ZT7SRJYLVH,"This is not as good as the Frozen Lemon juice, but it is good"
179,B0025VRCJY,A3L9ZT7SRJYLVH,"It has a slightly odd flavor, perhaps from a preservative"
179,B0025VRCJY,A3L9ZT7SRJYLVH,Sure wish I could order the frozen juice
180,B005CJVVJ8,A3O8ZE8BHREE0W,Couldn't believe it when told how relaxing this beverage was
180,B005CJVVJ8,A3O8ZE8BHREE0W,"Seriously, drink it only if you are getting ready for a nap or bedtime"
180,B005CJVVJ8,A3O8ZE8BHREE0W,If you have plans to drive or perform any other activity not recommended
180,B005CJVVJ8,A3O8ZE8BHREE0W,I feel my arms and legs almost tingle with relaxation
180,B005CJVVJ8,A3O8ZE8BHREE0W,After a short time my eyes start to get droopy and I am in another place
180,B005CJVVJ8,A3O8ZE8BHREE0W,Love this stuff
181,B005CJVVJ8,A3BSTFFIKK5YTW,I bought these at Grocery Outlet here in the Seattle Tacoma are for $4
181,B005CJVVJ8,A3BSTFFIKK5YTW,00 a case of tweleve not paying $38
181,B005CJVVJ8,A3BSTFFIKK5YTW,00 Yes 3 for a dolla
181,B005CJVVJ8,A3BSTFFIKK5YTW,I like the taste not great but not bad either low calorie will buy more but not at this whacked out price
182,B005CJVVJ8,A3F44FUPG97AA9,This is an great product
182,B005CJVVJ8,A3F44FUPG97AA9,"The taste is great, and it works exactly as described"
182,B005CJVVJ8,A3F44FUPG97AA9,Superb natural sleep aid
182,B005CJVVJ8,A3F44FUPG97AA9,AMAZING
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,"WE have been looking for ""natural"" ways to help us sleep since we always seem to be overloaded with stress and a busy schedule"
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,"Yes, we'd probably be better served taking a yoga class, but this is a good second choice"
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,This helps you fall asleep and stay asleep
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,I drank half the first night and that was plenty for me
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,"After about 30 minutes, I was ready for bed"
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,"I woke up refreshed and with no sleepy-drug hangover, so that is a huge bonus"
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,I gave the product 3 stars (instead of the 5 it deserves) as their packing job was marginal at best
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,"The product arrived with 2 broken bottles, which at this price is a $6 loss"
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,The bottles are glass and all they did was wrap one layer of the small-bubbled bubble wrap around the case and placed it in a larger box with extra room to move around in that box
183,B005CJVVJ8,A1AL946PZ24084,"Big packing fail, but the product is awesome"
184,B001KUUNP6,A262Z0S6PT9U16,We made chocolate chip cookies with BRM Garbanzo Bean Flour and the results were fantastic
184,B001KUUNP6,A262Z0S6PT9U16,The brown sugar and chocolate mask any bean taste that other reviews have mentioned
184,B001KUUNP6,A262Z0S6PT9U16,Our friends couldn't discern any difference from classic CCCs
184,B001KUUNP6,A262Z0S6PT9U16,"The texture, body, and elasticity (meaning reduced tendency to fall apart that occurs with most other gluten-free flours) is nice and chewy -- the same as CCCs made with regular flou"
184,B001KUUNP6,A262Z0S6PT9U16,And an added bonus -- the high protein and fiber level (I calculate 2-3 g fiber/cookie) fills you up so that you are satisfied with smaller servings and the glycemic index is significantly lowe
184,B001KUUNP6,A262Z0S6PT9U16,I highly recommend this flour even if CCCs are the only thing you make with it
185,B001KUUNP6,A317BY3IPZ83MJ,This  is great stuff
185,B001KUUNP6,A317BY3IPZ83MJ,Made some really tasty banana bread
185,B001KUUNP6,A317BY3IPZ83MJ,Good quality and lowest price in town
186,B001KUUNP6,A18VJ0WOQAIZYD,"We had trouble finding this locally - delivery was fast, no more hunting up and down the flour aisle at our local grocery stores"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,This packet of glaze is the secret to making those European style fresh fruit tarts
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"I am about to make one for a pie auction at church, after a friend requested that something ""strawberry"" should be offered"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"You can make the most amazing and relatively ""healthy"" fruit tarts by baking a base, layering it with uncooked, fresh, sliced fruit, then pouring over the made-up contents of one of these packets"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"They harden up at room temperature, hold the fruit together so you can slice the tart, and they let the beauty of the arranged fruit show through"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"I've also seen this glaze used over cheesecakes, to hold a fruit topping in place"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"Personally, I do not like cheesecake (too rich for me) but a fruit glazed cheesecake is gorgeous, I will admit"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"To do this, slice fruit and layer it on the cheesecake while it's still in the springform pan"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"Pour on the glaze, let it set up and then remove the springform"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,You'll have a clear layer of fruit on top of the cheesecake
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"Cherries, strawberries or sliced mangos are nice, but the best one I ever had used thin slices of lemons, that had been gently poached in sugar syrup before they were layered on the cake"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"I use a base of sponge cake, baked in a shallow form, but other bases can be pate sucre  (a kind of French pastry that is a bit like a sugar cookie) that works well in those fluted, straight-sided forms"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"You can also make mini-tarts in a muffin pan, pre-baking each mold with a layer of pie crust (even commercial crust works, though again, I prefer pate sucre, it holds its shape better and is more substantial and has a better crum"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,") Just blind-bake the muffin tins lined with pate, then pop them out and fill with fresh fruits (berries are great) and pour over the glaze"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"Some people put a layer of creme patisserie, which is a pastry cream like custard but stabilized with flour,  below the fruit and I happen to think these taste best"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"If you get into baking, this glaze is a must-have on the shelf"
187,B000NY8ODS,A1IU7S4HCK1XK0,"The ingredients are vegan: tapioca starch, carrageenan, dextrose, cream of tartar, locust bean gum, so if you are looking to make a vegan tofu cheesecake, you can use this on top, as well as use it for fruit tarts with a nut crust base"
188,B00029XIZI,A2S72TUJDQUBMH,My Scotties were full of hot spots and when I used this within a week all the hot spots were gone
188,B00029XIZI,A2S72TUJDQUBMH,"The smell is kinda strong, but not bad"
188,B00029XIZI,A2S72TUJDQUBMH,It's tolerablel
189,B004V6AH34,ATX44LVZL5JFV,I bought this coffee because its much cheaper than the ganocafe and has the organic reishi mushroom as well as other healthy antioxidants
189,B004V6AH34,ATX44LVZL5JFV,"I didn't expect it to taste good, but it actually does"
189,B004V6AH34,ATX44LVZL5JFV,I've only had it for a few days and for $5 its totally worth it
189,B004V6AH34,ATX44LVZL5JFV,My sisters all take ganocafe but now I'm introducing them to this less expensive similar coffee
189,B004V6AH34,ATX44LVZL5JFV,I will follow up on this product in a few weeks
189,B004V6AH34,ATX44LVZL5JFV,:)
190,B004V6AH34,A3AFVGFX175F9N,The coffee is very finely processed and the flavor is just alright
190,B004V6AH34,A3AFVGFX175F9N,"Nescafe and Mount Hagen are better - I bought this to try something other than these two, but I probably won't get this again"
190,B004V6AH34,A3AFVGFX175F9N,"There is just a slight ""vitaminy"" taste, but it's not overwhelming"
190,B004V6AH34,A3AFVGFX175F9N,It's also a bit pricey for what you get
191,B004V6AH34,AXAJ1GHE97YE2,This coffee is great because it's all organic ingredients
191,B004V6AH34,AXAJ1GHE97YE2,"No pesticides to worry about, plus it tastes good, and you have the healing effects for ganoderma"
192,B004V6AH34,A3POAWC2JPQQQP,"Like the other people mentioned, this coffee has a great taste"
192,B004V6AH34,A3POAWC2JPQQQP,"I've tried different instant coffees before, but this one is one of the better ones"
192,B004V6AH34,A3POAWC2JPQQQP,"Another one of my favorites, if you want to try it out (though NOT organic), is 'Africafe pure instant coffee'"
193,B004V6AH34,AJZ2A9UOJK0RB,"Tastes great, and gives me energy without the jitters"
193,B004V6AH34,AJZ2A9UOJK0RB,Love this product
193,B004V6AH34,AJZ2A9UOJK0RB,"However, I do wish it came in some sort of resealable jar or hard plastic container instead of a zip-lock pouch because the zip-lock ripped off and quit working after awhile"
193,B004V6AH34,AJZ2A9UOJK0RB,"But the product is fantastic, just not crazy about the packaging"
194,B0028C44Z0,A19NGYCQ1NCF3W,These little guys are tasty and refreshing
194,B0028C44Z0,A19NGYCQ1NCF3W,I usually eat salads for lunch which can do terrible things to breath
194,B0028C44Z0,A19NGYCQ1NCF3W,I eat 2 of these after lunch (because they are so small) and I find this sufficiently resolves the problem
194,B0028C44Z0,A19NGYCQ1NCF3W,They're sugar free (sugar can actually help the smelly bacteria grow) which is great and they're tasty enough that I almost think of them as part of my lunch
194,B0028C44Z0,A19NGYCQ1NCF3W,This is a good bulk value buy and I'd highly recommend the mints themselves
194,B0028C44Z0,A19NGYCQ1NCF3W,Cheers
195,B0028C44Z0,A32DDKLY942A84,"I like these better than the regular Altoids, but they're even more costly, so you'd better like them"
196,B0028C44Z0,A3B6S35IUGOGW4,These little tins of sugar free mine mints were a great deal
196,B0028C44Z0,A3B6S35IUGOGW4,There perfict for on the go
196,B0028C44Z0,A3B6S35IUGOGW4,Fifty mints per tin is just the right amount to cary along
196,B0028C44Z0,A3B6S35IUGOGW4,And there safer for your teeth than the ones with suga
196,B0028C44Z0,A3B6S35IUGOGW4,The price of twelve dollars was very resonable
196,B0028C44Z0,A3B6S35IUGOGW4,Also there great for shareing
196,B0028C44Z0,A3B6S35IUGOGW4,If you are looking for a mint try these ones
196,B0028C44Z0,A3B6S35IUGOGW4,Youll be glad you did
197,B0028C44Z0,AI7O5C9KBVSTF,"Pros:<br />+packaging, shipping, price<br />+sold about a year before its expiration date (enough for me to eat/share 9 boxes)<br />+not too ""fresh"" like the regular wintergreen and not in a powdery form"
197,B0028C44Z0,AI7O5C9KBVSTF,it's a real mint
197,B0028C44Z0,AI7O5C9KBVSTF,Cons: none
198,B0028C44Z0,A4LL4KXLRBQHQ,"Be careful not to eat too many of them in one day, as one of the chemicals in it is the same as that of a LAXATIVE"
198,B0028C44Z0,A4LL4KXLRBQHQ,LOLOLOL
199,B0028C44Z0,A3U94LRA4I8YAL,These mints are really strong and have a great taste
199,B0028C44Z0,A3U94LRA4I8YAL,They are also a convenient size to carry in a pocket or purse
200,B0028C44Z0,A1WTXY4MW3YDF2,This is a huge supply of them
200,B0028C44Z0,A1WTXY4MW3YDF2,I'm still working on these and have plenty to spare
200,B0028C44Z0,A1WTXY4MW3YDF2,Much more effective than buying one from the grocery store or 7-11 every time you want a mint
201,B0028C44Z0,A1UF2VN3O50NGW,"Even with small containers, they don't fill them up"
201,B0028C44Z0,A1UF2VN3O50NGW,These little tins are less than half filled and at the price charged it seems a rip-off
201,B0028C44Z0,A1UF2VN3O50NGW,Is there some exotic ingredient as costly as gold contained in those tiny squares
201,B0028C44Z0,A1UF2VN3O50NGW,"Or how about the cereal ploy, they were filled at the factory but settled in transport"
201,B0028C44Z0,A1UF2VN3O50NGW,Can manufacturers be honest in their dealings
202,B0028C44Z0,A3VAYCK681VZZO,"I love, and use the empty containers for medicine/advil in my purse, desk, suitcase"
202,B0028C44Z0,A3VAYCK681VZZO,Also line with felt to keep earrings
202,B0028C44Z0,A3VAYCK681VZZO,Perfect little size to disguise small valuables when traveling and LOVE the mints
202,B0028C44Z0,A3VAYCK681VZZO,Tiny and powerful without burning my mouth
203,B0028C44Z0,A3TIC20I6XI297,Received as shown
203,B0028C44Z0,A3TIC20I6XI297,My mother in law likes these and Walgreens quit carrying them
203,B0028C44Z0,A3TIC20I6XI297,It was great i could get them on Amazon
204,B0028C44Z0,A2Q8F5N7HQXWDW,I keep a case of these in my office and always have at least a tin or two on my desk for visitors to help themselves to
204,B0028C44Z0,A2Q8F5N7HQXWDW,Some folks stop by just to grab some mints and others pop them like candy while we meet
204,B0028C44Z0,A2Q8F5N7HQXWDW,When I find someone who keeps coming back for more I just give them their own tin
204,B0028C44Z0,A2Q8F5N7HQXWDW,One co-worker asked me to save the tins for her so she could use them as pillboxes and safety pin boxes
204,B0028C44Z0,A2Q8F5N7HQXWDW,"Like I said, theyre a real hit"
204,B0028C44Z0,A2Q8F5N7HQXWDW,"Since I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off a candy dish, this is a good alternative to have around and it's nice to have them around if I have garlic for lunch"
204,B0028C44Z0,A2Q8F5N7HQXWDW,I gave the item 4 stars because they aren't as tasty as the sugar version of the mints  but what sugar free item is as good as it's full sugar counterpart
204,B0028C44Z0,A2Q8F5N7HQXWDW,) and because of the fact that each tin is wrapped in plastic which seems like a waste and is irritating to remove (although I totally get why they wrap it - it still doesn't make it easy to deal with)
205,B0028C44Z0,A2RMYCQIST622H,The tiny Altoids are great for a quick breath freshening and the small box is great for portability
205,B0028C44Z0,A2RMYCQIST622H,"It's full, but compact"
205,B0028C44Z0,A2RMYCQIST622H,"I haven't run out yet, and probably won't for a couple months, but I can't wait to buy it again"
206,B0028C44Z0,A27D5IRAIGLOG5,"I loved these Wintergreen Altoid Smalls so much, I had to come write a review"
206,B0028C44Z0,A27D5IRAIGLOG5,"The packaging is small for convenience, and the Altoids are smaller as well with a square shape, blue hue, and even more delicious taste in my opinion"
206,B0028C44Z0,A27D5IRAIGLOG5,I definitely prefer them over the regular-size Altoids and will continue purchasing them
206,B0028C44Z0,A27D5IRAIGLOG5,Highly recommended
207,B0028C44Z0,A5F7YR0G7H9HR,Fresh scent and taste
207,B0028C44Z0,A5F7YR0G7H9HR,Easy to eat one tin in few hours
207,B0028C44Z0,A5F7YR0G7H9HR,I use them as favors and everyone loved them
208,B0028C44Z0,A2E0MNOYZI00VW,Hard to find the wintergreen smalls [sugar free] as stores only have the red smalls [peppermint --such a common flavor]
208,B0028C44Z0,A2E0MNOYZI00VW,The wintergreen is refreshing and absolutely delicious
208,B0028C44Z0,A2E0MNOYZI00VW,"Driving cross country, if someone cuts me off, I turn to my daughter with my hand out and say ""Wintergreen Me"
208,B0028C44Z0,A2E0MNOYZI00VW,""" She pulls one out, puts it in my hand, and all is right with the world"
209,B0028C44Z0,A3BJ9NS09YGQT5,"To me, these are nothing like the regular Altoids and are not breath mints"
209,B0028C44Z0,A3BJ9NS09YGQT5,"They are pleasant-tasting little candies in a cute convenient tin, and that's as far as it goes"
209,B0028C44Z0,A3BJ9NS09YGQT5,"The mintiness is just not strong, and the wintergreens are definitely weaker than the peppermint minis"
209,B0028C44Z0,A3BJ9NS09YGQT5,"I'm not a dragon-breath person, but still, one of these mints is too small to have any effect on my breath"
209,B0028C44Z0,A3BJ9NS09YGQT5,Four or five will freshen my breath for a short while - maybe 15 minutes
209,B0028C44Z0,A3BJ9NS09YGQT5,"At this point, I think the Icebreakers Frost mints are the best as sugar free breath mints"
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,we have fed our cats a lot of stuff
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,These 2 boy cats are not picky eaters
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,They loved the Purina
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,They loved the Nutro
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,They loved the Iams
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,They love whatever we feed them
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,"This review is based on what we, their affectionate owners love"
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,"After a certain age, we were instructed by the vet to consider senior foods- and lower carb foods, because the catties were fatties"
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,We tried a few types of food
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,Some evinced no change
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,Some made the litter super-stink
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,Some had too small a kibble and the cats barfed it up because they didn't have to chew it to swallow it
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,This Felidae has done the trick
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,No problems to speak of
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,It is consistent in the litter and bearable on the nose
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,The cats love it
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,The kibble is sized appropriate to chewing
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,"And here's the kicker:<br />After feeding the cats Felidae, their demeanor improved"
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,Their coats are super soft and lush- both are new improvements we can directly attribute to this food
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,We're now loyal Felidae consumers
210,B0009XLVGA,A3S84SEN2Z6DZU,"Additionally, the absence of corn product in the feed seems to lessen or remove the reactions of our friends with cat-allergies"
211,B0009XLVGA,A2U3Z5S70AE80V,I started my cat on Felidae Platinum about 3 weeks ago and she loves it
211,B0009XLVGA,A2U3Z5S70AE80V,"She's an older cat, somewhat overweight, and had a grouchy temperament"
211,B0009XLVGA,A2U3Z5S70AE80V,I first mixed it with her previous food and she figured out which was which -- she ate the Felidae and left the old food
211,B0009XLVGA,A2U3Z5S70AE80V,"She's now been on just the Felidae for about ten days now, off the old food entirely, and she is a much sweeter, happier cat"
211,B0009XLVGA,A2U3Z5S70AE80V,"I think it must agree with her better or be more easily digested, or something"
211,B0009XLVGA,A2U3Z5S70AE80V,"In any case, I am a happy purchaser of Felidae"
211,B0009XLVGA,A2U3Z5S70AE80V,I don't agree with the previous reviewer that cats don't like it
211,B0009XLVGA,A2U3Z5S70AE80V,"Clearly, mine does"
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,"We have three cats, the youngest is about eleven years old, another is fifteen and our oldest is, well ancient"
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,That is what the vet told us ten years ago
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,The youngest is a blo
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,"When he lays down, he looks like a footstool"
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,The other two are arthritic and skinny
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,"Since we had such success with Canidae Platinum for senior dogs, I figured that we'd give it a try for our cats"
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,I'd had them on low ash Purina One Urinary tract formula for their entire lives and thankfully we had no UT problems
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,"Buster, the youngest, is still a blob after six months plus on Felidae for Senior and Overweight cats"
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,"However, the other two are now much more active and we can tell that they are really ""feeling better"" since we changed their food to Felidae"
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,"Even Prissy, the ancient one has started to play and tease the dogs by getting them to chase her, where before when she was on Purina One, all she wanted to do was to sleep"
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,"I think that if you can get your cat on this fairly early in their weight problems, it'll be more effective"
212,B0009XLVGA,ATHUN0PJ0MG0P,"However, the glucosamine will certainly help your older fur balls have a happier life"
213,B0009XLVGA,A2LWOW7SO2QPML,Too much of a good thing
213,B0009XLVGA,A2LWOW7SO2QPML,"We worked this kibble in over time, slowly shifting the percentage of Felidae to national junk-food brand until the bowl was all natural"
213,B0009XLVGA,A2LWOW7SO2QPML,"By this time, the cats couldn't keep it in or down"
213,B0009XLVGA,A2LWOW7SO2QPML,What a mess
213,B0009XLVGA,A2LWOW7SO2QPML,We've moved on
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,"As with canidae, Felidae has also changed their formula"
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,Cats do not like change when it comes to their food
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,And they just had to change it without putting it on their label
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,We noticed the color of the food had changed and so did the smell
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,"(As you will notice I have also reviewd the Canidae, and this all happened the same time the dogs were having issues"
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,)<br /><br />Prior to the change in food we had almost lost two of our cats because we had moved to a new home
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,"If cats get ""upset"" because of a change in enviorment, or a loud noise they can stop eating"
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,It depends on the cat
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,Two of them had stopped eating and had lost a lot of weight
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,We took them to the vet and it took months to get them back to normal
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,It has been a year since then and they are bette
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,Then the formula for this food changed
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,We started to noitce they were not eating as much and it started to bug us
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,We asked the shop owner of the feed store and she had no knowledge of any change to the food
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,It wasn't until the we were in there with other customers yelling about their dogs food making their dogs sick
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,Right away we changed the cats food and they started chowing down and haven't suffered one bit like our dogs have
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,Cats are sensitve animals and changes to thier food could cause them to stop eating
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,Anyone thinking of purchasing this food should not do it
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,"We have 5 rescued and fixed cats, none of which are picky eaters and the change in this formula could have been the death of them had we not found out about the change in their formula"
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,I urge anyone that has had these problems to go to the consumer affairs website and also the FDA website and write a letter to them to let them know how this has affected your animal
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,"As with canidae they do not care how the change has affected my animals, and tell me not to buy it"
214,B0009XLVGA,A1NHQNQ3TVXTZF,This is just horrible
215,B002TDK0VK,A3FU8FVBZ8ZODD,Don't buy just a few of these
215,B002TDK0VK,A3FU8FVBZ8ZODD,I order these by the case
215,B002TDK0VK,A3FU8FVBZ8ZODD,I can't even remember the first time I tasted an anchovy stuffed olive but I have tried several of the brands online and this brand is my favorite
216,B002TDK0VK,A24HJWXL3LHULM,I order these olives a lot
216,B002TDK0VK,A24HJWXL3LHULM,They are un-like any other olives out there
216,B002TDK0VK,A24HJWXL3LHULM,The subtle flavors of the brine go great with cheeses
216,B002TDK0VK,A24HJWXL3LHULM,One of my favorite appetizer treats for guests
217,B002TDK0VK,A3GRP8QRFGDH8T,"Hey, the description says 360 grams - that is roughly 13 ounces at under $4"
217,B002TDK0VK,A3GRP8QRFGDH8T,00 per can
217,B002TDK0VK,A3GRP8QRFGDH8T,No way - that is the approximate price for a 100 gram can
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,My husband and I are both kind of wimpy when it comes to hot things and this seasoning is just a bit too spicy for us
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,It definitely makes you sweat a bit when you're eating it
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,It was still edible to us by adding a good sized dollop of sour cream but I don't think I would buy it again due to the heat
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,We prefer the milder McCormick's brand of Fajita mix
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,I've also had fajitas in a couple of different restaurants and it wasn't as spicy as this mix is
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,If you like super spicy then this is not burning hot so you might want to keep that in mind
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,To me it was more than medium hot but not by too much
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,I gave it three stars because it was pretty easy to make and it's versatile in that you could vary the veggies you put in it
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,"You take a plastic bag, a couple of tbs of vegetable oil, 1/4 cup water and mix the seasoning, water and oil together then add the chicken strips to the bag and let it marinate for 5 minutes"
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,"In the meantime, it says to stir fry your veggies (peppers and onion) but I found it easier to just cook the chicken and veggies together and I don't think it affected quality or taste"
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,I also used extra virgin olive oil rather than vegetable oil
218,B0040WAG7Q,A19SDJ2TSSL8HI,I have one more package of this to use and next time I'm going to add more veggies and maybe some chopped tomato to cut the heat a bit more
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,A friend who'd been drinking tea for 80 of his 84 years introduced me to this tea a few months ago
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,Even took me over to the store and bought me a pound
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,At $7/l
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,"in a retail store or a little over $9 with shipping from an online merchant, I think it's great"
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,"I've been drinking Earl Grey, English Breakfast, Irish Breakfast, Lapsang Souchong, Assam, etc"
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,Most of them were over $30/l
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,with shipping
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,"Aside from the Lapsang Souchong, I think this is a great replacement for all the rest"
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,"Has everything I'm looking for in a strong, full-bodied black tea with enough character to keep it from becoming boring"
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,My current favorite afternoon tea
219,B001EO5ZMO,AW497M5SEXAPQ,"Unless you're extremely jaded or a tea snob, you'll love it"
220,B001EO5ZMO,A3KQ1480MHXXCW,"I love strong, full bodied quality tea and typically drink assam, irish breakfast or early grey tea, but as the other reviewer noted the price per pound can be discouraging"
220,B001EO5ZMO,A3KQ1480MHXXCW,"So I have been searching for a quality full bodied tea that wasn't bitter at a more palatable price point, and this certainly fits the bill"
220,B001EO5ZMO,A3KQ1480MHXXCW,"And unlike some other teas where they tend to be better in one form or another, i"
220,B001EO5ZMO,A3KQ1480MHXXCW,e
220,B001EO5ZMO,A3KQ1480MHXXCW,iced vs
220,B001EO5ZMO,A3KQ1480MHXXCW,"hot, this tea is excellent in both forms"
220,B001EO5ZMO,A3KQ1480MHXXCW,I would certainly recommend this to anyone who prefers that smooth full bodied quality tea that doesn't cost an arm and leg
221,B001EO5ZMO,A8D27L5Q5BLRC,"I drink this tea plain (without sugar or milk), and it has a pleasant aroma"
221,B001EO5ZMO,A8D27L5Q5BLRC,The price from Amazon is cheaper than my local grocery store
221,B001EO5ZMO,A8D27L5Q5BLRC,"One reviewer is right, I think it has some herbal smell to make up the aroma"
221,B001EO5ZMO,A8D27L5Q5BLRC,"So the label ""Imperial Blend"" kind of implied the he"
221,B001EO5ZMO,A8D27L5Q5BLRC,"I am not exactly a black tea drinker, so this tea is a surprise, and affordable too"
221,B001EO5ZMO,A8D27L5Q5BLRC,"I usually prefer White Chinese tea, like White Peony, but it is more expensive, and requires lower temperature wate"
221,B001EO5ZMO,A8D27L5Q5BLRC,"But this is black tea, and this aroma kind of remind me the 'softness' of white tea"
222,B001EO5ZMO,A1C5SHU81SRARN,I've tried a variety of Ahmad tea
222,B001EO5ZMO,A1C5SHU81SRARN,"Not because I particularly like this brand, but they are just easier to come across"
222,B001EO5ZMO,A1C5SHU81SRARN,"The Imperial blend, I believe, is the most complex yet well balanced of all the ones I've tried"
222,B001EO5ZMO,A1C5SHU81SRARN,"It's full body like a good cup of Assam, which by no means overpower the delightful, clean taste of Darjeerling, complete with a long lasting note of bergamot"
222,B001EO5ZMO,A1C5SHU81SRARN,I enjoy it best in the evening
222,B001EO5ZMO,A1C5SHU81SRARN,It gives a satisfying and relaxing finish to a busy day
222,B001EO5ZMO,A1C5SHU81SRARN,"For those interested in the specifics: I use about 3 teaspoons of lose tea in a stainless steel infuser in a 16 oz mug, let it steep in 208F water for 2-3 min, take the infuser out, and drink it without sugar or milk to savor its sophistication"
223,B001EO5ZMO,A3JP1UJAF8YY0F,"I have tried literally dozens of teas since being introduced to the Russian custom of preparing and drinking tea, and the Ahmad Imperial blend is probably my favorite of all of these due to the fact that it is equally delicious hot or iced"
223,B001EO5ZMO,A3JP1UJAF8YY0F,I buy the three-packs as needed from Amazon and go through them rapidly
223,B001EO5ZMO,A3JP1UJAF8YY0F,"My family loves it and my friends have it in their homes now too, try one box of it and you will love it too"
224,B001EO5ZMO,A8XEEORIXJNZL,This is an excellent tea
224,B001EO5ZMO,A8XEEORIXJNZL,One of the best I have ever had
224,B001EO5ZMO,A8XEEORIXJNZL,It is especially great when you prepare it with a samova
225,B001EO5ZMO,A3A4GAPXRX5SHM,Herbal additives in this blend destroy real tea taste
225,B001EO5ZMO,A3A4GAPXRX5SHM,It is only for people who like herbal taste
225,B001EO5ZMO,A3A4GAPXRX5SHM,I don't
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,"Makes a tasty, super easy meal, fast"
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,BUT high in calories
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,The instructions say to saute the veggies first but I recommend cooking the chicken first
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,The chicken takes longer to cook and the raw chicken ontop of veggies just makes a slimy mess
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,I made it with snow peas and carrots only
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,I dont like the little corn
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,Added some red pepper flakes for heat and served ontop of rice
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,It came out wonderful
226,B001SATU8E,A1CR1DS15Z7XO1,Dinner on the table in less than 30mins
227,B007JFV6RK,A2WQBT7RS1HSSU,I think I have tried just about every Bloody Mary mixer on the market at one time or the othe
227,B007JFV6RK,A2WQBT7RS1HSSU,"Most have too much sugar or worst, corn syrup"
227,B007JFV6RK,A2WQBT7RS1HSSU,This mixer is all natural ingredients and very tasty
227,B007JFV6RK,A2WQBT7RS1HSSU,It does have a little kick
227,B007JFV6RK,A2WQBT7RS1HSSU,Enjoy
228,B007JFV6RK,A3LCMQ815MBJW9,"Might be a little spicy for some, but this stuff rocks"
228,B007JFV6RK,A3LCMQ815MBJW9,"I use 1/2 and1/2 with V8 for a milder version , or the best is a Bloody Caesa"
228,B007JFV6RK,A3LCMQ815MBJW9,"Half mix ,half clamato"
229,B007JFV6RK,A2UC5JUVHIF80L,Took me one or two to get used to the pickle taste
229,B007JFV6RK,A2UC5JUVHIF80L,But now aim hooked and have to keep a bottle on hand
230,B001L4ELRW,A1AK335P17JXL0,This candy is not as described
230,B001L4ELRW,A1AK335P17JXL0,The middle is almost hard it is not a silky or smooth filling as described
230,B001L4ELRW,A1AK335P17JXL0,Looks and tastes like it's way past it's expiration date
230,B001L4ELRW,A1AK335P17JXL0,Would never reccommend this
230,B001L4ELRW,A1AK335P17JXL0,Paid a good chunk of cash for nothing
231,B003SO503C,A2ODZ3CH8PMYTL,I started drinking the power slim tea when I was on the HCG diet to help curb cravings
231,B003SO503C,A2ODZ3CH8PMYTL,"Since I liked it so well, I tried some of the others and I am now hooked"
231,B003SO503C,A2ODZ3CH8PMYTL,They are so satisfying that I drink them all the time
231,B003SO503C,A2ODZ3CH8PMYTL,"The Energy gives you that extra pick-me-up in the afternoons that helps keep me going all day, no matter how long"
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,I'm trying several of the Wu Yi teas
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,I like this one particularly because of the subtle citrus taste
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,It also has a natural sweetness
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,"The ingredients include Organic Wu-Li Cliff Oolong Tea (700 mg), Organic Black Tea (600 mg), Organic Green Tea Extract (100 mg), Proprietary blend (600 mg), plus some Ginseng (panax), Orange Peel, Lemon Grass, and Guarana"
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,Other Ingredients: Natual Orange and Citrus flavors
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,My goal is to drink more tea and less coffee
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,I am enjoying trying a different kind of tea every day
232,B003SO503C,A3OXRFCJI67IMN,I'll be coming back to this one
233,B003ZFXJDW,A2HL6876LDPJIM,"i cannot live without this citron falksalt, it is wonderful on watermelon, fish, almost any food requiring salt and in my world it all does"
233,B003ZFXJDW,A2HL6876LDPJIM,"just try it on red juicy watermelon, wonderful experience"
234,B003ZFXJDW,A2KPPGFMPD20M6,Terrible
234,B003ZFXJDW,A2KPPGFMPD20M6,"Artificial lemon taste, like Pledge Lemon Furniture Polish"
234,B003ZFXJDW,A2KPPGFMPD20M6,Don't do this to yourself
234,B003ZFXJDW,A2KPPGFMPD20M6,Just use plain flake salt and some fresh grated lemon zest
235,B003ZFXJDW,AJ94Y22SUFCGU,These things are huge
235,B003ZFXJDW,AJ94Y22SUFCGU,"I love the way the crystals crunch, and the flavor is not too overpowering or too subtle"
235,B003ZFXJDW,AJ94Y22SUFCGU,This lemony flavor is my favorite--it's good on almost everything
235,B003ZFXJDW,AJ94Y22SUFCGU,You'll have plenty of flavored salt for a long time if you buy this
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,"The taste of these white cheddar flat breads is like a regular cracker - which is not bad, except that I bought them because I wanted a cheese taste"
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,What was a HUGE disappointment
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,How misleading the packaging of the box is
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,The photo on the box (I bought these in store) makes it look like it is full of long flatbreads (expanding the length and width of the box)
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,Wrong
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,"The plastic tray that holds the crackers is about 2"" smaller all around - leaving you with about 15 or so small flatbreads"
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,What is also bad about this is that the company states they use biodegradable and eco-friendly packaging
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,FAIL
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,They used a HUGE box for a ridiculously small amount of crackers
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,Not ecofriendly at all
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,Would I buy these again
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,No - I feel ripped off
236,B001HTL6CY,A1KLA02LZXAT46,The other crackers (like Sesame Tarragon) give you a little<br />more bang for your buck and have more flavo
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,This is the ultimate puppy food
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,The kibbles are great for small breeds
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,High in digestible nutrients as opposed to fillers some companies use
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,Less waste results from the high quality ingredients
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,"I have been hunting, training, showing and handling various breeds of dogs for nearly 40 years, with multiple National Champions"
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,I have been highly satisfied with Eukanuba's quality and the results I have obtained feeding their foods
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,"My recent purchases are with WAG, through AMAZON"
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,com
237,B000WFRMRW,A2GN6W82DZNUN8,Their prices are the best I have found and they are very good at shipping immediately on items in stock
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,The recommendation when we bought our puppies (lhasa/bichon mix and lhasa/poodle mix) was that we continue them on the food that they have had since being weaned
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,This is a somewhat expensive food so I can't say that we were terribly pleased but we loaded up on the stuff and headed home
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,"Let me just say this, I have had small dogs before"
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,Never have I seen such gas issues
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,Both of them consistently had foul gas
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,Consistently
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,"Usually when they're sitting on our laps but, you know"
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,They're dogs
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,"When we got through the first bag of this stuff, we purchased more on amazon"
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,It was a great price for it since we got a 40 lb bag for the price of (I think) a 15 lb bag at Petco
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,"But, they continued to have gas"
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,"I mean, they loved the food, don't get me wrong and they loved it more when we'd mix in some water and it would be like soft food"
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,Somehow that made their gas worse but I think I'll have to give that responsible to the speed with which they chowed down- can't blame the food itself for gluttony
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,"Eventually, we switched their food"
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,No more farting
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,I think it was due to the high fat content which undoubtedly is necessary for very small puppies
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,They just need that in their diet
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,I think that we were advised to keep them on it for much longer than was useful (they said up until 1 year)
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,"Yeah right, you try dealing with gas for that long"
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,Around 6 mos of age we switched to PuppyChow
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,Much bette
238,B000WFRMRW,A3Q7QBDSAZ670I,"Granted, they don't like it as much, but we humans like it a whole lot bette"
239,B001EO5ZME,AF72GTWZGAC61,A very delicate green tea with a smooth light taste and an subtle floral tones and no bitter aftertaste
239,B001EO5ZME,AF72GTWZGAC61,In the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed
239,B001EO5ZME,AF72GTWZGAC61,The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years
239,B001EO5ZME,AF72GTWZGAC61,I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon
239,B001EO5ZME,AF72GTWZGAC61,) because only a few stores carry it in my area and they are quite a few miles away
239,B001EO5ZME,AF72GTWZGAC61,The current deal for the pack of 6 is superb (much cheaper than I can find locally)
239,B001EO5ZME,AF72GTWZGAC61,"This is a great tasting tea, which I am happy to recommend"
240,B0093NIWVO,A1JT114SOITFFO,"Fresh,a great way to get a little chocolate in my life without a million calories"
240,B0093NIWVO,A1JT114SOITFFO,They taste just like chocolate pudding
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,"If you like the Ceylon tea variety, you will certainly enjoy and appreciate this tea"
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,I am so happy to find Ahmad teas available here (thanks Amazon
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,) and very surprised at the negative review from 2009 because in the 20+ years we have been drinking Ahmad teas not even once have we been disappointed
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,The superb quality of Ahmad teas has remained consistent throughout the years
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,The current deal for the pack of 4 is very good (cheaper than I can find locally)
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,Highly recommended
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,NOTE: This listing's description is confusing
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,"Each packet of tea weighs 500 grams, which equals 1"
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,1 pounds or 17
241,B001EO5ZMY,AF72GTWZGAC61,6 ounces
242,B001EO5ZMY,AOSK1PLKNT64,I've been enjoying this tea for years
242,B001EO5ZMY,AOSK1PLKNT64,"This tea is good mornings, afternoons or evenings"
242,B001EO5ZMY,AOSK1PLKNT64,My local store went out of buisiness
242,B001EO5ZMY,AOSK1PLKNT64,Thanks Amazon
242,B001EO5ZMY,AOSK1PLKNT64,I use a bodum tea press to prepare a pot
243,B001EO5ZMY,A1DAHZRJTX5X1Z,"Hi, I have to have black tea everyday"
243,B001EO5ZMY,A1DAHZRJTX5X1Z,I have done it in the past 25 years and it's a habit of mine
243,B001EO5ZMY,A1DAHZRJTX5X1Z,Ahmad tea is one of my favorite brands and I highly recommend it if you like black tea
243,B001EO5ZMY,A1DAHZRJTX5X1Z,I think this is going to remain my favorite for the next 100 years or so :)
244,B001EO5ZMY,A7WE8ZWEJG34E,I have tried it out despite the other review and I found that this is exactly the same tea i buy in either Russian or Italian groceries
245,B001EO5ZMY,A1W4LZ4VZDF29Y,Ahmad Tea is an excellent looseleaf tea eith hot or for making iced tea
245,B001EO5ZMY,A1W4LZ4VZDF29Y,Great flavor with no lingering aftertaste
246,B001EO5ZMY,A3E81HFGNME65J,"I've been drinking this tea for the past 8 or 10 years, usually buying a box or two when visiting large metropolitan areas, where many Middle-Eastern stores carry loose Ahmad teas, usually at $5-7 for a pound box"
246,B001EO5ZMY,A3E81HFGNME65J,"I've always considered it an unremarkable but robust tea, with enough aroma and taste, and beautiful reddish color, perhaps not good enough a tea to drink on its own, but a decent base for mixes"
246,B001EO5ZMY,A3E81HFGNME65J,"This tea, however, is nothing of the sort"
246,B001EO5ZMY,A3E81HFGNME65J,"Freshly opened package has almost no characteristic tea smell, and the brewed tea is weak, flat and tasteless"
246,B001EO5ZMY,A3E81HFGNME65J,Somehow it just does not seem to be the same product anymore
246,B001EO5ZMY,A3E81HFGNME65J,"So, you get a lot of tea for the money, but the quality is such that you might as well drink Lipton bags, they are not that much worse"
247,B007TFONH0,AMRNVZKWF6519,I love love love this deal - it's way fun to pick from so many
247,B007TFONH0,AMRNVZKWF6519,Teas and chocolates and ciders as well as many coffees
247,B007TFONH0,AMRNVZKWF6519,"The other outfits that assemble samplers are boring - they do the choosing, and from a much narrower range"
247,B007TFONH0,AMRNVZKWF6519,"The sellers here are very nice, also, and will answer questions via email about the slightly confusing ordering method (it's easy)"
247,B007TFONH0,AMRNVZKWF6519,"If you want great packaging, forget it - they ship fast, and the kups are just tossed loose in a box"
247,B007TFONH0,AMRNVZKWF6519,Who cares
248,B007TFONH0,A10IFYN5U6X20R,"Once you've tried some random sampler packs (and now are overloaded with decafs,extra bolds, or teas), this is a great way to get exactly the brands or style that you want"
248,B007TFONH0,A10IFYN5U6X20R,Received the order in a couple of days and was exactly what I ordered
248,B007TFONH0,A10IFYN5U6X20R,This was my second order and I'll be ordering this item again
249,B007TFONH0,A3ICO2ROSXHIPM,good products and fast shipping equals a happy me
249,B007TFONH0,A3ICO2ROSXHIPM,a little pricey but you can hand pick a few good flavors
249,B007TFONH0,A3ICO2ROSXHIPM,a few i cant find anywhere else so def worth the price
250,B000GGKQSO,A1OE23J37ZPDXE,If used on a daily basis you will keep your gums healty and between your teeth clean and free of plack
